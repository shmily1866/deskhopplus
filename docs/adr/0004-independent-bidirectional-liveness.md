# ADR-0004: Independent bidirectional liveness, carried by traffic rather than by acknowledgement

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-11
- **Resolves:** [#68](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/68)
- **Constrains:** [#52](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/52) and the clipboard slices, [#49](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/49) (the Windows helper), and the session section of spec [#42](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/42)
- **Related:** [#69](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/69) — the single outbound frame slot this decision is shaped around

## Decision

Liveness on the channel is **symmetric and independently timed in each direction**, and it is
carried by **any traffic**, not by an acknowledgement.

- Each end considers its peer alive while **any frame** has arrived from it inside
  `DH_SESSION_ABSENT_MS` (three heartbeat intervals). Traffic in a direction is itself the proof,
  in **both** directions and with nothing excluded — clipboard bulk and a refused hello count as
  much as a heartbeat does. Crediting only heartbeats at either end would evict a peer in the
  middle of its own traffic, because that peer suppresses its beat exactly when it is busiest.
- A heartbeat is emitted **only when that direction has been idle** for a full interval. It is a
  filler for a quiet link, not the liveness signal. A busy link emits none at all.
- `DEVICE_HEARTBEAT` (`0x06`, d→h, empty) is added so the device→helper direction has a filler of
  its own. It is sent only while a session exists, so its absence is meaningful.
- `SESSION_END` (`0x07`, d→h, `reason:u8`) is added so the device can announce an eviction it knows
  about, rather than leaving the helper to wait out a timeout. It is an **optimisation over** the
  timeout and never a substitute: a device that reboots or wedges announces nothing.

Both ids sit in the session band, so the firmware never forwards them and the routing decision
stays a single range test.

## Context

The v1 heartbeat was one-way. A helper beat every second and the device refreshed a timestamp;
nothing travelled back. The device drops a session on three paths that send nothing — its own
liveness timeout, a framing error on its reader, and a version mismatch. On the first two the
helper went on beating into a device that ignores heartbeats, with no ack to miss and no re-hello
timer, and its menu bar kept reading *connected and paired*.

A fourth path was claimed during the design session and is **not** a defect: the config chord
calls `dh_session_drop` in `channel_open_pairing_window`, but that function's only caller is
`setup.c`, on the normal-mode boot *after* the chord's reboot, where `channel_init` has just
cleared the session and no helper has yet said hello. The helper learns of that eviction from the
USB re-enumeration, which is a louder signal than any frame. Recorded here because the claim
reached the issue and this ADR before it was checked, and because a `re_paired` reason code
briefly existed to serve it. That code and its golden vector were removed rather than reserved:
a wire format should not carry a value nothing emits, held open for a caller that does not exist.
If the window ever becomes openable while a session is live, the reason is one line to add back,
in the same change that makes it reachable.

The cost of the gap rises sharply at the first payload. Cursor placement degrading quietly is
survivable; a helper that believes it holds a session it does not will offer clipboard content that
never arrives, and the paste side will wait on a transfer nobody is sending. Hence settled before
#52 rather than after.

## Why acknowledgement lost

The obvious mechanism — the device answers each beat — was rejected for a reason worth recording,
because it is the option a future reader will assume was correct.

**An acknowledgement only proves anything while the helper is still asking.** The first failure
path is a helper whose own beats *stalled rather than stopped*; that helper has stopped asking, so
it never notices the missing answers. The mechanism is blind to one of the exact cases motivating
it. Two free-running timers have no such hole: each end is watching for something the other end
sends unprompted.

## Why traffic rather than a dedicated beat

This is the part that will look wrong at a glance, since #68 itself rejected "treat existing
traffic as liveness" on its face. That rejection was correct **in the helper→device direction**,
where placement is fire-and-forget and may not happen for hours, so absence proves nothing. The
inverse proposition is what is used here: the *presence* of a device→helper frame proves the device
is alive and holds an authenticated session, because every such frame either came from the session
layer itself or is one the device authenticated to this helper before emitting it.

(That last clause was `dh_session_may_relay` — one flag for the whole board — until
[ADR-0008](0008-channel-identity-and-sealed-clipboard.md) replaced it with a tag on every frame
(#111). The property this argument rests on is unchanged and is now stronger: a device→helper frame
carries a tag under the session key, so it could only have come from the device holding it. The
helper→device direction changed in the same way, and there it is a fix rather than a restatement —
under v1 the deadline measured "*something* is writing", which on a shared endpoint (#95) let a
second writer hold the device's view of the helper alive after the real helper had stopped.)

The forcing constraint is `channel_queue_frame`: **one frame slot**, shared by relayed bulk, and a
refusal is silent loss with no retransmit beneath it (#69). A once-per-second beat competing with a
sustained clipboard transfer would be refused repeatedly, three refusals is a false eviction, the
transfer is abandoned, and the reconnect starts a transfer that dies the same way. A beat that
fires only on an idle link **fabricates none of this**: a busy link emits no beat at all, and a
refused beat is self-correcting, because the slot being busy means something else is going out that
refreshes the peer anyway.

So the mechanism designed to detect a broken session would, in its obvious form, have manufactured
broken sessions — and only once #52 landed, which is the deadline it was written to beat.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| **Acknowledged heartbeat** — the device answers each beat | Blind to a helper whose beats stall rather than stop, which is the first of the four failure paths. Also a strict 1:1 obligation inside the frame handler, and one guaranteed frame per second per direction contending for the single out slot. |
| **Dedicated device beat, sent unconditionally** | Contends with relayed bulk for the one outbound slot; refusals are silent, and three of them is a false eviction mid-transfer. Idle-gating it costs one timestamp and removes the failure mode entirely. |
| **Reuse existing traffic *instead of* a beat** | Rejected in both directions. Placement is fire-and-forget and may be hours apart, so *silence* proves nothing — which is what the idle-gated beat is for. Note this rejects traffic as a *substitute* for the beat, not traffic as proof of life: arrival still refreshes the deadline, in both directions. Conflating the two is what #68's original framing did, and it is why the first implementation credited only heartbeats on the device side. |
| **`SESSION_END` as the mechanism, with no timeout** | A device that reboots, wedges, or loses power announces nothing. Announcement is an optimisation on top of a timeout, never in place of one. |
| **Hoist the helper session engine into the shared core** so #49 inherits the detector | After idle-gating, the detector is one comparison against a constant the core already exports. A C module wrapping it would be worse code than the duplication it prevents. The larger question — whether all of the helper's session logic belongs in C — is real but far bigger than #68, and is tracked separately. |

## Consequences

- **The heartbeat becomes conditional in both directions.** Existing helper tests that assert a
  beat at exactly `heartbeatInterval` become "a beat only if nothing else was sent."
- **`dh_session_tick` stops returning `bool`.** The eviction transition *is* the emitted
  `SESSION_END`, so the signal and the frame are one thing that cannot disagree. `dh_session_drop`
  splits: a silent form for a lost link, where there is nobody to tell, and `dh_session_end`, which
  drops and encodes.
- **The detector is scoped to a session, never to a phase.** A helper refused authentication stays
  connected, beating and asking, because #46's silent provisioning only works on a helper that is
  connected when the chord lands. Keying the detector on the phase would tear that down every three
  seconds and break pairing outright.
- **`DH_PROTO_VERSION` does not change.** v1 is unreleased, the registry change is additive, and
  the version check is exact equality, so a bump would only force a mismatch nothing benefits from.
- **#52 inherits a seam**, not a condition to invent: bulk may be sent only while a session is
  established, exposed once and tested here.
- **#49 inherits the constants and the wire format**, which is all there is to inherit; #68's
  acceptance criterion was amended to say so.
- The glossary (`CONTEXT.md`) now separates **Link**, **Connection** and **Session**. Having one
  word for all three is why this defect was invisible: a dead session and a live connection look
  identical when you cannot name the difference.

## Amendment, 2026-08-25 — the idle timer belongs to what actually went out

The rule above says a heartbeat is emitted only when that direction has been idle for a full
interval. It did not say *who decides the direction carried something*, and the two ends of the
helper answered differently.

The clipboard path charged the idle timer only for a frame the transport had taken, and said so at
the call site: *"Charging for one it refused would suppress a beat that ADR-0004 owed the board."*
The session path — which is where the beat itself is — charged it at **build** time, inside
`dh_helper_tick`, before the platform had been asked. Both helpers then discarded their transport's
answer for session frames, so a refused beat was silently lost **and** bought a full interval of
silence it had not earned.

The board evicts a helper after `DH_SESSION_ABSENT_MS`, which is three intervals. Three refusals in
a row therefore ends the session, with nothing at either end able to say why.

**That is a defect in its own right and is not claimed to be
[#107](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/107)'s cause.** #107's evictions run from 0.2 s to
6,811 s apart, and the low end of that cannot be an idle timeout at all: `DH_SESSION_ABSENT_MS` is a
3,000 ms floor, `last_seen_ms` is set where the session is established and only one code path sets
`present`, so no idle timer can evict a session younger than three seconds. Two in the current log
were evicted at 1.2 s and 2.0 s of age. Whatever that is, it is not this.

**One rule now, in one place:** `dh_helper_note_sent` is what charges the timer, and the beat is not
exempt. `dh_helper_tick` builds the beat and stops there. The hello and the pair request still
charge at build time, deliberately — each has its own timeout and re-sends itself, where the beat
has nothing behind it.

A platform that never charges the timer beats on every tick. That is the safe direction to fail
in — noisy rather than silent — and it is why this is a removal rather than a callback. On macOS
`ChannelTransport.send` also loses its `@discardableResult`, so the compiler now refuses a caller
that ignores whether a frame went out.

**This does not close #107 on its own.** The measured symptom is the board timing the helper out at
irregular intervals, and nothing yet shows this defect firing on hardware. What ships beside the fix
is the reading that would show it: `DH_NOTE_SESSION_ENDED` now carries how long this helper had gone
without getting a frame out, so a liveness end says whether the two ends agree about the silence.
They disagreeing means frames are being lost between them; they agreeing means the helper really did
stall, and those are different faults.

## Amendment, 2026-08-27 — the heartbeat trace follows liveness evidence

The helper's diagnostic originally timed the gap since the last literal `DEVICE_HEARTBEAT`. That
contradicted the decision above: authenticated traffic deliberately suppresses the idle filler and
replaces it as proof of liveness. A sustained transfer therefore produced `device heartbeat quiet`
and `resumed` lines while the device was continuously proving that it was alive. Hardware validation
for [#144](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/144) reproduced the false pair on both helpers
with zero outbound refusals and no session loss; the same pair also appeared during ordinary idle
use when other authenticated traffic crossed the channel.

Once the first literal beat establishes the trace, **any authenticated device frame advances its
evidence clock**, exactly as it advances the session's liveness clock. A later idle filler is not a
resumption from a fault: the direction remained live, and the filler was not owed while traffic
crossed it. Unauthenticated traffic still advances neither clock.

This does not weaken the silence detector. `last_device_frame_at` remains the authoritative timeout,
and a direction carrying neither traffic nor its idle filler still ends the connection after
`DH_SESSION_ABSENT_MS`.
