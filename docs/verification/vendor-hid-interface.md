# Verifying the always-on vendor HID interface

The procedure behind [#25](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/25). It exists as a
document rather than a one-off checklist because the descriptor is touched again by
[#20](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/20) (identifiers) and possibly
[#58](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/58) (web config off mass storage), and every
descriptor change has to answer the same questions on the same hardware.

**Historical baseline:** The byte counts below describe #25. Issue #222 adds a separate
config-mode helper channel, so the config-mode descriptor is no longer byte-for-byte identical.
Its new interface, WebHID coexistence, DESKHOP disk, and both board roles require fresh hardware
verification before #222 is closed.

**Why hardware.** Enumeration and descriptors are outside the host test seams by decision
(#15, *Explicitly not tested at a seam*). The specific unknown is #59's finding U2: DeskHop's
keyboard interface is declared `HID_ITF_PROTOCOL_NONE` yet works at BIOS and disk-encryption
prompts, so the risk of adding an interface is not boot-protocol negotiation but **whether
firmware that tolerates the current descriptor tolerates a longer one with a higher interface
count**. That is not answerable from source.

## #222 config-mode validation (pending on real boards)

Flash the same candidate firmware on both boards and run the matching macOS helper. Repeat with
the config chord on board A and on board B while the peer board stays in normal mode. Record each
result on #222; a check not run is not a pass.

- [ ] Normal mode still exposes two helper channels and reaches **Connected and paired**.
- [ ] Config mode exposes the WebHID config API (usage `0x10`), DESKHOP disk, and a separate
      helper channel (usage `0x20`) without an Input Monitoring prompt.
- [ ] The helper reconnects with one channel and shows **Connected and paired — config mode**;
      unplugging it or denying its channel shows **Device in config mode** after the silence window.
- [ ] Save a multi-monitor Layout and cross in both directions while the page remains connected;
      verify the correct monitor, cursor query, and placement on each computer.
- [ ] Clipboard sharing works through the one-channel session while the peer board is in normal mode.
- [ ] The DESKHOP disk still accepts a firmware upgrade, and Exit and the five-minute timeout both
      reboot back to a fresh normal-mode session. A new helper can still pair after Exit.
- [ ] Keyboard and mouse still work in config mode on both boards and at the pre-boot prompts
      used in the #25 checklist below, because this descriptor gained an interface.

## Historical #25 checklist

### What changed, so a failure can be attributed

Verified by decoding both descriptors out of the built ELF and diffing against a build of the
previous commit:

| Descriptor | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Config mode | 107 bytes, 4 interfaces | **byte-for-byte identical** |
| Normal mode | 59 bytes, 2 interfaces | 91 bytes, 3 interfaces |

In normal mode exactly three things differ: `wTotalLength` (59 → 91), `bNumInterfaces`
(2 → 3), and 32 appended bytes describing the new interface. **Interfaces 0 and 1 are
byte-identical**, so a keyboard or mouse regression cannot be caused by a changed keyboard or
mouse descriptor — only by the presence of a third interface. That is the single variable
under test.

The new interface: number 2, class HID, its own report descriptor of vendor-page collections
only, interrupt OUT `0x03` and interrupt IN `0x83`, both 64 bytes at 1 ms.

### Recording results

Copy the checklist into the issue and fill it in. A check that cannot be run is recorded as
**not run**, never as a pass.

#### 1. macOS — driverless, and free of TCC

```
python3 tools/macos-checks/confirm_hid_tcc.py
```

Expected: three nodes listed. The keyboard and mouse nodes carry
`RequiresTCCAuthorization: YES` — that is pre-existing and harmless, nothing opens them. The
third node must show `0xff00/32 vendor` alone with `RequiresTCCAuthorization: no`, and the
script must print `PASS`.

Baseline on stock firmware for comparison: two nodes, both flagged, and the script fails with
*no node publishes the channel usage*.

- [ ] Interface binds with no kext, no entitlement, no permission prompt
- [ ] Script prints PASS — the ADR-0001 confirmation
- [ ] Serial number is reported and matches the board

#### 2. Windows 11 — driverless, no administrator rights

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\windows-checks\Confirm-HidExclusivity.ps1 `
    -Check A,E -VendorId 0x1209 -ProductId 0xD35C -Usage 0x20
```

(The parameters are named in full because a PowerShell parameter binds a variable of the same
name, and `$Pid` is a read-only automatic variable — a `-Pid` parameter fails at bind time.)

Run **as a normal user**, not elevated: "without administrator rights" is part of what is
being measured.

**Pass `-Vid/-Pid/-Usage`.** Without them the script picks its target by a heuristic that
prefers a vendor collection supporting feature reports — and the channel deliberately has
none, so the heuristic would skip it, measure some unrelated vendor device on the laptop, and
report a pass that says nothing about this device. With them, a run that cannot find the
channel fails visibly instead. Confirm the `TARGET:` line names VID `0x1209` / PID `0xD35C`
before recording anything below.

- [ ] The device appears in Device Manager with no driver installation and no unknown device
- [ ] Check A inventories the new vendor collection, and `TARGET:` names it
- [ ] Check E shows it refusing a zero-access open while a `dwShareMode = 0` handle is held —
      the second ADR-0001 confirmation
- [ ] Existing keyboard and mouse function normally on this machine

#### 3. The one that cannot be answered from source

**Normal mode only.** #25 originally asked for both descriptor variants, but the config-mode
descriptor was shown to be byte-for-byte identical to its predecessor, so its pre-boot
behaviour cannot have changed and re-testing it measures nothing. Only the normal-mode
descriptor grew an interface. Should a future change touch the config-mode descriptor, this
section grows back.

**Switch to the machine under test first.** The device routes the keyboard to one output at a
time (`Left Ctrl + Caps Lock`). Rebooting a computer the device is not pointed at looks
exactly like a keyboard failure and is the easiest way to record a false negative here.

- [ ] Windows: keyboard works at the UEFI/BIOS setup prompt
- [ ] Windows: keyboard works at the BitLocker pre-boot prompt, or *not applicable* if the
      machine unlocks from the TPM without prompting
- [ ] macOS: keyboard works in Startup Manager (hold Option at power-on)
- [ ] macOS: keyboard works at the FileVault unlock screen, or *not applicable* if disabled

If any of these fail, the interface count is the cause and the finding belongs in the issue
before anything else is built on the channel.

#### 4. Nothing else regressed

- [ ] Keyboard, mouse, consumer and system control all work on both computers
- [ ] Switching between computers works
- [ ] Config mode still enumerates its mass-storage interface
- [ ] The web config page loads and reads values
- [ ] Firmware upgrade through config mode still works

### Confirm both boards moved, whether or not the version did

Since [#91](https://github.com/myn/deskhopplus/issues/91) the heartbeat carries the running
image's checksum beside its version, and `handle_heartbeat_msg` asks
`fw_upgrade_should_pull`: board B pulls from a **newer** peer board, or from one at the
**same version with a different image**. A descriptor change therefore propagates without a
`VERSION_MINOR` bump, because changed code means a changed checksum.

That removes the failure this section was written for, but not the check. Measured on
2026-08-10, before the change: the macOS side had the channel interface and the Windows side
did not, purely because the version had not moved. A split pair presents different USB
descriptors to the two computers and is the thing to rule out.

**Still verify propagation by confirming both computers see the new interface**, not just the
one whose board was flashed directly. Two cases still need the number moved: putting an
*older* image on the pair, and moving board **A**, which never follows B — see
`docs/verification/helper-channel.md`.

### Do not flash from macOS if it can be avoided

The config-mode `DESKHOP` volume is not a general-purpose drive — it is a small FAT image
served by the firmware. macOS writes `.fseventsd`, and often `._` resource-fork files, onto any
volume it mounts, and those unexpected directory entries can make the device reject the image.
The failure is silent in the worst way: the volume disappears and the device reboots exactly as
it would on success, but it comes back running the *old* firmware.

Observed 2026-08-10: the first flash from macOS worked with only `config.htm` on the volume; a
second flash minutes later, by which time macOS had created `.fseventsd`, left the board on its
previous firmware with no error anywhere. It was only detectable indirectly, because the peer
board never upgraded.

Prefer flashing from Windows, or use the ROM bootloader below. If a flash from macOS appears to
do nothing, assume it was rejected rather than that it succeeded.

### Recovery

The ROM bootloader is always reachable: hold the on-board button while connecting the Pico and
copy any `.uf2` to the `RPI-RP2` drive that appears. This works regardless of device state, so
a descriptor that breaks enumeration is recoverable without special tooling.
