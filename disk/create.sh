# Build the config disk image that ships inside the firmware.
#
#   ./create.sh [page] [image]     defaults: ../webconfig/config.htm, disk.img
#
# mtools only — no loopback mount and no root, so this runs identically on
# macOS, Linux and CI. The previous version needed mkdosfs and a `sudo mount`,
# which meant it could not run on the development machine at all and the image
# had to be patched by hand or left stale (#16).
#
# The volume is deliberately larger than what ships. `mformat` lays out 2 MB of
# FAT12 and only the first 64 kB is kept, because that is all the firmware
# stores: `src/ramdisk.c` reports NUMBER_OF_BLOCKS (4096) to the host and
# serves zeros past ACTUAL_NUMBER_OF_BLOCKS (128). Keep FULL_SECTORS and
# SHIPPED_SECTORS below in step with those two.
#
# Output is byte-reproducible across machines, which is what lets CI regenerate
# the image and compare it against the committed copy. Three things have to be
# pinned for that: `-N 0` fixes the volume serial, SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH fixes the
# directory entry timestamp, and the OEM field is overwritten below because
# mformat stamps its own version into it.
