"""How much of the shipped config disk the page uses, and whether it fits.

The volume is deliberately a lie. `mformat` lays out a 2 MB FAT12 filesystem
and only its first 64 kB is kept, because that is all the firmware stores:
`src/ramdisk.c` reports NUMBER_OF_BLOCKS (4096) to the host and serves zeros
past ACTUAL_NUMBER_OF_BLOCKS (128). A page that overflows those 128 sectors
therefore does not fail — the host writes it, the FAT says it is there, and
the bytes are simply gone. That is the truncation this check exists to turn
into a build failure.

Capacity is read out of the image's own boot sector rather than hardcoded, so
changing the geometry cannot leave a stale number here. The shipped size is
the image file's own length, which is the same thing said a third way.

    usage: capacity.py <image> [page]

Exits 1 if the page does not fit, 0 otherwise. With no page argument it only
reports.

DH_SHIPPED_SECTORS overrides the length taken from the file. create.sh needs
that: it has to know whether the page fits *before* copying it in, and at that
point the image is still the full 2 MB that mformat laid out. Asking after the
truncation would be asking after the bytes were already lost.
