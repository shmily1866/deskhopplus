"""Where two disk images differ, as byte ranges.

Diagnostic only. The config disk is not byte-reproducible across mtools
versions — mformat writes version-dependent content into the boot sector, and
overwriting the OEM field was not enough on its own — so CI checks that the
image *carries the current page* rather than that its bytes match. This says
what did differ, so if reproducible bytes are ever wanted again the fields to
normalise are named rather than guessed at.

    usage: imgdiff.py <a> <b>

Always exits 0: a difference is information here, not a failure.
