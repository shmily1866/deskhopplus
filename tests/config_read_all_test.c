/*
 * The cursor of a config Read All (#156).
 *
 * GET_ALL_VALS_MSG used to queue one HID response for every mapped field in a
 * single pass. Two requests arriving before the first drained asked the queue
 * for more than it holds, and queue_try_add's refusal was ignored, so the tail
 * of the second response was dropped without a word.
 *
 * The walk hands out one field per drain pass instead, so the queue never has
 * to hold the whole map. What has to be right is small and entirely arithmetic:
 * every field is handed out exactly once, a response the queue refused is
 * offered again rather than skipped, and a restart mid-walk still covers the
 * whole map. All three sat inside a handler that needs a device to reach.
 *
 * Style follows config_test.c: an assertion macro, a main, a printed failure
 * line, a non-zero exit — no framework.
