/*
 * Whether a firmware upgrade being received is still alive (#90).
 *
 * The defect this guards was invisible from the board: an upgrade that
 * stopped left `upgrade_in_progress` set for good, and the heartbeat, the
 * config-mode timeout and the config-mode LED all sat behind that flag. The
 * board looked healthy while being unreachable, and only a power cycle got it
 * back.
 *
 * Three ways to be wrong: never noticing a stall, calling a healthy transfer
 * stalled (which costs a manual reflash once flash has been written), and
 * mistaking "no upgrade at all" for a stalled one.
 *
 * Split out of tasks.c and handlers.c for the same reason peer_fw.c was split
 * out of the UART handler (#89): behind a task the decision could not be
 * reached.
 *
 * Style follows peer_fw_test.c: a named assertion macro, a main, a printed
 * failure line, a non-zero exit — no framework.
