/*
 * The peer board's firmware version, as tracked from its heartbeats (#89).
 *
 * Four ways to be wrong, all invisible from the board itself: reporting a
 * version for a peer that has gone, forgetting one that is still there,
 * rendering "never heard from" as though it were a version, and -- since #91
 * put two builds at one version number -- calling two different images a
 * match because their versions agree.
 *
 * Split out of handlers.c for the same reason config_store.c was split out of
 * the flash path (#74): the arithmetic is pure, and behind a UART handler
 * nothing could reach it.
 *
 * Style follows config_test.c: a named assertion macro, a main, a printed
 * failure line, a non-zero exit — no framework.
