 * Where each writer of flash reaches, and which of them must never reach the

 *
 * This gates the one failure that would be silent and permanent: peer
 * propagation copies board A's running image onto board B (#91, measured
 * working 2026-08-18), and the upgrade path writes every page of that image.
 * An identity key inside the copied range would give **both boards the same
 * identity** — every helper would then pair with something that is not the
 * board it thinks it is, and nothing anywhere would say so.
 *
 * The ranges below are written out as what each caller actually passes to
 * flash, not derived from the constants they are being checked against, so a
 * region that moves has to move in two places to pass.
 *
 * Style follows frame_test.c: an assertion macro, a main, a printed failure
 * line, a non-zero exit — no framework.
