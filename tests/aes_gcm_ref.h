 * A reference AES-256-GCM, for the host tests only (#113).

 * It is here and not in src/core/ on purpose. ADR-0008 put the seal's cipher on
 * the platform — CryptoKit on macOS, CNG on Windows — so that neither helper
 * ships a hand-written AES and the firmware links none at all. The C suite
 * still has to be able to open what the core sealed, so it carries its own
 * plain implementation, gated by the published NIST GCM test cases in
 * seal_test.c before anything else uses it.
 *
 * Correctness only: no attempt at constant time, and nothing here should ever
 * be linked into something that ships.
