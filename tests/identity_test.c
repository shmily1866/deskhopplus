 * The board's stored identity: what validates, what does not, and that a

 *
 * Small, and deliberately so. What makes it worth having is #74: the same
 * arithmetic for the configuration lived behind write_flash_page, was wrong
 * *identically* in both directions, and therefore agreed with itself on every
 * round trip while every stored config silently failed. The cost there was the
 * user's settings. The cost here is the board's identity, which cannot be
 * regenerated without unpairing every helper registered against it.
 *
 * Style follows frame_test.c: an assertion macro, a main, a printed failure
 * line, a non-zero exit — no framework.
