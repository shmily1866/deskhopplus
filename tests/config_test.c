/*
 * Configuration validation on the host (#74).
 *
 * The defect this exists to prevent shipped because nothing could reach it.
 * save_config and load_config both took the CRC over
 * `sizeof(config_t) - sizeof(uint32_t)`, which excludes the checksum only
 * while the checksum is the last four bytes of the struct. #46's secret took
 * config_t from 136 to 160 bytes and left four bytes of padding *behind* the
 * checksum, so the CRC started covering the checksum field itself. Save and
 * load then hashed different content, the comparison could never match, and
 * every boot fell back to defaults — losing the pairing secret and every
 * other setting with it.
 *
 * It was invisible to tests because the arithmetic was identically wrong in
 * both directions and both lived behind flash I/O. The decision is now split
 * out (config_store.h) so the arithmetic can be tested without a device, and
 * the interesting case is the *tail*: a checksum that stops short still
 * round-trips perfectly, so a round-trip test alone proves nothing. Every
 * byte ahead of the checksum has to be shown to matter.
 *
 * Style follows frame_test.c: an assertion macro, a main, a printed failure
 * line, a non-zero exit — no framework.
