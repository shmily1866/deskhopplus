/*
 * Why the measure-only ECDH build (#110) has no heartbeat.
 *
 * The heartbeat is what carries this board's firmware version and checksum to
 * its peer, and handle_heartbeat_msg on the far side pulls the image whenever
 * it differs -- on a strictly newer version, or on an *equal* version carrying
 * a different image (#91). The measuring image is exactly that: same version,
 * different bytes. Left announcing, it would propagate itself onto the peer
 * board, and getting the real firmware back onto board B costs a cable trip.
 *
 * So it stays quiet. The peer simply does not learn what this board is
 * running, for as long as the measurement takes.
 *
 * The UART build (#166) keeps it, on purpose: it takes two boards to measure
 * a link, board B cannot be flashed by cable, and that same pull is the only
 * way to reach it. The product image goes back the same way, by flashing
 * board A with it.
