/*
 * A measure-only build: how long one P-256 ECDH actually takes on this chip.
 *
 * NOT part of the product. Compiled only when the firmware is configured with
 * -DDH_BENCH_ECDH=ON, and the resulting image is a measuring instrument, not
 * something to leave on a board — it types into whatever has focus and it
 * does nothing else useful.
 *
 * Why it exists: ADR-0008 estimates a P-256 ECDH at 80-200 ms on this chip and
 * says plainly that the number is unmeasured, and #110 requires the real one
 * before #111 designs around it. Core 0 runs six jobs in one cooperative loop
 * with no preemption, including the keyboard and mouse queues at 2000 Hz
 * (src/main.c), and the watchdog budget is 500 ms (src/include/watchdog.h).
 * An 80 ms cost and a 400 ms cost are different designs.
 *
 * The answer is typed as keystrokes because the board is already a keyboard.
 * Both stdio paths are off in this firmware (CMakeLists.txt), the UART pins
 * carry the inter-board link, and adding a CDC interface would change the USB
 * descriptor set — which is a bigger change to the thing being measured than
 * the measurement is worth.
 *
 * Usage is in tools/board-checks/README.md.
