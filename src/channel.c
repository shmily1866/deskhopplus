     * Then to the session, which is where the number is worth something
     * (#133): the helper is attached while the fault is happening, so it can
     * read these live, at the moment of a stall, with no reboot at all.
     *
     * Published every pass rather than on change: these are counters, and a
     * reader of one is asking what the total is now. The session decides for
     * itself whether a fresh reading is worth a frame.
