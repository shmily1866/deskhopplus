    /* A modifier is held by the host, not by the board: the OS believes the
       last report it was given until a later one says otherwise. Any reset
       that skips the release therefore strands a modifier the board cannot
       see - reset_usb_boot on the flash path returns immediately, and a
       watchdog reset or a power cut announce nothing by construction. That
       was #138, a phantom GUI key after a flash.

       Enumeration is the one moment every one of those has in common, and it
       is the moment the host's own belief is empty, so an empty report is
       what agrees with it. Not every mount follows a reboot - a replug or a
       host resume lands here with RAM intact and a key possibly still held -
       and clearing unconditionally is still right: the host that just
       enumerated holds nothing either way, and both state arrays are
       overwritten wholesale by the next report from their source
       (update_kbd_state, update_remote_kbd_state), so a key held across the
       mount is back the moment its keyboard speaks again. handle_output_select_msg
       already releases on the same reasoning.

       One report per attach, and it drains in config mode too - that identity
       keeps ITF_NUM_HID. It goes out in report protocol, so a boot host that
       switches protocol afterwards gets a replacement from
       tud_hid_set_protocol_cb (#67). */

       channel_link_lost and not channel_init, which would take an open

       it with no caller, so the window kept dying to a bus reset the header
       already said it survived. Not re-reading flash here costs nothing —
       every path that changes the registration in the running config tells the
       pairing module itself, and the board's identity is drawn once for its
       whole life. Config mode is decided at boot, where channel_init still
