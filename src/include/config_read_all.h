/*
 * Where a config Read All has got to (#156).
 *
 * GET_ALL_VALS_MSG used to queue one HID response for every mapped field in a
 * single pass, before USB had any opportunity to drain them. That made the
 * whole map have to fit in the queue, and two requests arriving before the
 * first drained did not fit: queue_try_add's refusal was ignored, so the tail
 * of the second response was dropped silently and the page rendered those
 * fields empty.
 *
 * A walk hands out one field per drain pass instead, so the queue only ever
 * has to hold what a single pass produces. A repeated request restarts the
 * walk rather than stacking on top of it, and every mapped field is still
 * sent.
 *
 * The two cores share one walk: the request can arrive on either (USB on core
 * 0, a peer board's proxied read on core 1), while the steps always run on
 * core 0 beside the drain. No lock is taken. What makes that safe is that
 * `count` holds the same value on every start — the field map does not change
 * at runtime — and that a confirmation carries the field it belongs to, so a
 * start landing between a step's peek and its confirmation is not credited
 * with a field the new walk has not sent.
 *
 * Pure C11: no SDK, no queue, no device state. tests/config_read_all_test.c
 * is the gate.
