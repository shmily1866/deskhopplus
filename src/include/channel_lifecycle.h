 * Reports waiting for channel_task, because none of the work below may run
 * inside the USB callback any more.
 *
 * This was four, on the argument that "USB full speed delivers at most one
 * 64-byte OUT report per millisecond and channel_task drains the whole ring at
 * 1000 Hz, so the steady state never exceeds one". That is the same premise
 * #139 measured false one queue over (dh_inq.h): channel_task is an entry in a
 * cooperative loop, not a 1000 Hz timer, and TinyUSB hands over whatever it
 * has buffered when the device task runs — so reports arrive in bursts inside
 * one pass, not one per millisecond.
 *
 * Thirty-two shared slots cover about 16 ms with two saturated channels. It is not a measurement,
 * because nobody has measured the worst pass; it is generous depth behind a
 * drop that is no longer silent, which is the change that matters: a drop
 * counts in `reports_dropped` (DEVICE_DROPS), so if this number is still too
 * small it says so. Since ADR-0012 the reader resyncs on the frame-start
 * flag, so the drop costs the frame riding it and nothing after (#188).
