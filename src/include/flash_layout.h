 * numbers, so the two cannot drift silently. What lives *here* rather than
 * there is the part a test can reach: which ranges each writer touches, and
 * whether any of them overlaps a range it must not.
 *
 * That question is not academic. Peer propagation copies board A's running
 * image onto board B (#91, measured working 2026-08-18), and the upgrade path
 * (#90, #104) writes every page of it. **An identity key inside that range
 * would give both boards the same identity** — which is exactly the failure
 * ADR-0008 put the identity in its own sector to prevent, and exactly the sort
 * of arithmetic that shipped wrong once already behind flash I/O no test could
 * reach (#74).
 *
 * Pure C11 — stdint and stddef only. Keep it that way, or the host test goes
 * with it. tests/flash_layout_test.c is the gate.
