 * The board's end of the helper channel (#45).
 *
 * All the decisions live in the shared core (src/core/dh_session.c, gated by
 * host tests); this is the plumbing that gives them a USB endpoint: reports in,
 * frames out, replies back, a clock for the liveness timeout, and the two
 * things a pure core cannot have — flash for the board's identity, and entropy
 * for its private key and its session nonces.
 *
 * Relaying bulk frames across the inter-board link is #47's, and pairing is
 * #111's. Both arrive on the same path, and under v2 both are authorised per
 * frame rather than per session (ADR-0008).
