 * The board's stored identity: what sits in the identity sector, whether it is

 *
 * Split out of the flash I/O for the reason #74 paid for: both halves of the
 * config checksum lived inside functions that read memory-mapped flash and
 * called write_flash_page, so neither could run on the host — and when the
 * range they summed became wrong, it was wrong *identically* in both
 * directions, so every round trip still agreed with itself and nothing failed.
 * Every setting was lost on every boot for as long as that lasted. The same
 * arithmetic, for a key the board cannot regenerate without unpairing every
 * helper, is worth a host test.
 *
 * What this is NOT is a second configuration. It holds one thing — the P-256
 * private key this board generated on first boot — and it has no version
 * migration story, because there is nothing here to migrate: a record this
 * firmware cannot read is a board that draws a fresh identity and re-pairs,
 * which is one chord press.
 *
 * Pure C11: no flash, no SDK, no I/O. tests/identity_test.c is the gate.
