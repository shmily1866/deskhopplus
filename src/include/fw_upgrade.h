 * The state of a firmware upgrade being received, and whether it is still
 * alive (#90).
 *
 * Two paths write this struct, and both can stop without saying so:
 *
 *   - the *pull*, where this board requests the image word by word from a
 *     newer peer board over the inter-board link (handlers.c, tasks.c);
 *   - the *UF2 drop*, where the host writes it as blocks onto the mass
 *     storage disk that only exists in config mode (ramdisk.c).
 *
 * Before this, `upgrade_in_progress` was set by both and cleared only by the
 * transfer finishing, or by a response arriving for the wrong address. A
 * transfer that simply stopped left the flag set for good, and everything
 * behind it in `heartbeat_output_task` — the heartbeat, the config-mode
 * timeout, the config-mode LED — stopped with it. The board went silent to
 * its peer, could never retry, could not time out of config mode, and looked
 * perfectly healthy while doing it. Recovery was a power cycle.
 *
 * So an upgrade now records when it last advanced, and a caller can ask
 * whether it has gone quiet for long enough to be abandoned.
 *
 * Pure C11: no SDK, no I/O, no clock of its own — the caller supplies the
 * time. tests/fw_upgrade_test.c is the gate. Same split, for the same reason,
 * as peer_fw.c (#89) and config_store.c (#74).

/*
 * How long an upgrade may make no progress before it is abandoned.
 *
 * Both paths advance far faster than this when they are alive: the pull asks
 * for the next four bytes at up to 4 kHz, and UF2 blocks arrive at USB mass
 * storage speed. Thirty seconds of nothing is not a slow link, it is a dead
 * one.
 *
 * Deliberately generous all the same, because abandoning costs something even
 * when it recovers: the pull restarts from address 0 and re-sends the whole
 * 256 KB image. The observed hang ran for over fourteen minutes, so a window
 * this wide still fixes it outright.

/*
 * How long to wait for a requested word before asking again.
 *
 * The pull has no acknowledgement and no retransmission beneath it, and a
 * request or its response can be dropped at either end: `uart_tx_queue` is
 * shared with mouse and keyboard traffic, and both `request_byte` and
 * `handle_request_byte_msg` enqueue into it. A single drop used to mean the
 * receiving board waited forever for a word that was never coming, because
 * `byte_done` is cleared by the request and set only by the response.
 *
 * Measured on hardware 2026-08-12: moving the cursor across the seam during a
 * pull was enough to lose responses repeatedly, and each loss cost a full
 * 30 s stall and a restart from address 0. Two of those in one transfer is
 * ROM recovery, which is how a board ended up in BOOTSEL for what was really
 * a dropped packet.
 *
 * A UART round trip is well under a millisecond, so 100 ms is around a
 * hundredfold headroom, and it leaves room for three hundred attempts inside
 * the stall window — which is what turns that window back into a backstop for
 * a genuinely dead link rather than the routine cost of a busy one.

/*
 * Which transport is delivering the upgrade being received.
 *
 * Two exist, and they share nothing but this struct: the *pull* asks the peer
 * board for the image a word at a time over the inter-board link, and the
 * *UF2 drop* takes it from the host as blocks on the config-mode disk.
 *
 * They used to be told apart by nothing at all. `upgrade_in_progress` said
 * only *that* a transfer was running, and firmware_upgrade_task — the pull —
 * took that flag as its cue to start asking. A drop was safe only by accident:
 * the pull also stood down while `byte_done` was clear, and a drop never sets
 * it. Re-requesting replaced that second guard with its opposite, since a word
 * that has not come back is now the cue to ask again. So a drop began making
 * this board pull its peer's entire image on top of the one the host was
 * writing: two writers on one flash, two transports summing into one checksum,
 * and the pull's own end-of-transfer checksum failing and handing the board to
 * ROM (#104).
 *
 * The transport is therefore recorded rather than inferred. NONE is zero,
 * which is what a zeroed struct and a board with nothing in flight both mean.

/*
 * Should this board pull the peer board's image?
 *
 * Two ways to answer yes, and they exist for different reasons.
 *
 * The *newer* peer board is the upgrade path: propagating a release from the
 * one board a host can flash to the one it cannot. Unchanged here.
 *
 * The *equal version, different image* case is the dev loop (#91). Before
 * this, a pull started only on a strictly newer version, so testing anything
 * that touched propagation cost a `VERSION_MINOR` bump per iteration — and
 * forgetting one produced a silent no-op that looked exactly like a broken
 * link. One evening of #90's hardware testing burned seven version numbers,
 * two of them purely to tell apart builds flashed at the same number.
 *
 * `follows_at_equal_version` is the caller's board role, and it is what keeps
 * that second case one-directional. Without it two boards at one version with
 * different images would each start pulling the other, and each would end up
 * writing the image the other was about to abandon. The firmware picks
 * `BOARD_ROLE == OUTPUT_B`, so board A leads and board B follows, matching
 * the workflow where A is the board a host can flash directly.
 *
 * **What this costs, stated plainly: at equal version the following board's
 * own image is not safe from its peer.** Two cases reach that, and neither is
 * hypothetical.
 *
 * *A board B flashed by hand.* B reaches ROM recovery, the user makes the
 * cable trip to the other machine (#58) and flashes it directly — and then B
 * pulls board A's image straight back over it, silently, on the next
 * heartbeat. Under the strictly-newer rule that hand flash persisted. The
 * consequence is accepted because the remedy is *cheaper* than the disease:
 * **flash board A, not board B.** A is the picotool-reachable board, B
 * follows it, and a rescue that starts at A costs no cable trip at all. That
 * inverts the old instinct, so the run sheet says it where a user in trouble
 * will read it.
 *
 * *A peer board on firmware older than this change*, which sends no checksum:
 * bytes 4-7 of its heartbeat still carry `active_output`, so it reads here as
 * 0 or 1 and looks like a mismatch. A bisect that flashes a pre-#91 build to
 * board A at an unchanged version produces this. There is deliberately no
 * guard, because a `!= 0` test would not catch it either — `active_output ==
 * OUTPUT_B` reads as checksum 1 — and the outcome is the same convergence on
 * A's image that the paragraph above accepts.
 *
 * Both are the feature working, not failing: the boards converge on whatever
 * board A is running. The hazard is only that it is silent, which is why it
 * is written down in three places rather than one.
 *
 * **This is not dev-only, and that was decided rather than defaulted.** #91
 * asked whether the equal-version case should hide behind `DH_DEBUG` or a
 * config flag, because it bypasses the strictly-newer rule that stops a board
 * clobbering a deliberately different image on its peer.
 * docs/adr/0007-inter-board-link-is-trusted-for-firmware.md answers no: a gate
 * would not close that exposure — a compromised board simply claims a higher
 * version and uses the path above — and board B's host blocks USB writes, so
 * the pull is how B receives firmware at all. Read that ADR before adding a
 * gate here.
 *
 * False whenever a transfer is already running, by either transport, so the
 * caller may ask unconditionally.
