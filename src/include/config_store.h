 * The split is the point. Both halves of this arithmetic used to live inside

 * neither could run on the host — and when the range they checksummed became
 * wrong, it was wrong *identically* in both directions, so every round trip
 * through the pair still agreed with itself and nothing failed. Every setting
 * was lost on every boot for as long as that lasted.
 *
 * Pure C11: no flash, no SDK, no I/O. tests/config_test.c is the gate.
