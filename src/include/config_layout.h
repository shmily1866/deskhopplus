 * Bumped whenever the field layout changes, so a config written by another
 * firmware is refused rather than read with the wrong shape.
 *
 * Bumping it is not free: every stored configuration stops validating and
 * every device falls back to defaults on the next boot. That costs the user
 * every setting *and* the pairing secret, so each bump is a chord press on
 * both boards before the helpers work again. Weigh that before changing it.
 *
 *   9: the channel pairing secret joined config_t (#46). An older
 *      configuration is not read as a newer one — it falls back to defaults,
 *      which is also how a device with no secret ends up needing one chord
 *      press.
 *  10: the bearer secret became a registration — the paired helper's key id
 *      and the shared secret one ECDH produced (#111, ADR-0008). The bump
 *      costs every board its pairing, and that is not a side effect: v2 does
 *      not migrate a v1 pairing, because a migration path would have to accept
 *      the bearer token, which is the thing being removed. One chord press.
 *  11: the single configurable toggle key became the complete thirteen-action
 *      hotkey table (#27), which necessarily extends the stored layout.
 *  12: each output gained its Ctrl/GUI swap setting (#22). The byte occupies
 *      former alignment padding, but old configurations cannot express the
 *      macOS-on default, so accepting them would silently choose the wrong
 *      behavior.
 *  13: each output gained its fixed-size remap profile (#26): 32 overrides
 *      and 16 passthrough usages. The profile changes the stored layout.
 *  14: each output's single screen position became independent chain and
 *      border directions (#24). Old bytes cannot express the split.
 *  15: each output gained four keyed, normalized seam ranges (#29).
