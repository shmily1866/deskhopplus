 * And no entropy source, which takes suppressing rather than configuring.

 * micro-ecc's platform-specific.inc defines a default RNG on every host it
 * knows — /dev/urandom on POSIX, CryptGenRandom on Windows — and uECC.c
 * initialises its global RNG pointer to it. That would put an open(), a
 * read() and a close() inside this core on the host builds, and pull
 * crypt32 into the Windows one against ADR-0006's inbox-only rule, for a
 * function nothing here ever calls: #110 requires the entropy to come from
 * the caller, as dh_pair_open_window already takes its fresh secret.
 *
 * Defining the include guard ahead of the include is what leaves it out.
 * micro-ecc offers no switch for this and must not be patched, so the
 * #error below is the safety net: if a future upstream renames that guard,
 * this stops compiling rather than quietly regaining a file descriptor.
 *
 * The name is a reserved identifier and is spelled that way on purpose — it
 * has to be the one micro-ecc uses, and no other spelling does anything.
