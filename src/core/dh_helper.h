 * deskhopplus shared core — the *helper's* side of the session (#79, #80).
 *
 * The board's side is dh_session.h. This is the other end of the same
 * conversation: the hello exchange, negotiation, ADR-0004's liveness, the
 * pairing exchange, all-or-nothing acquisition, the capped reconnection
 * backoff, and the states a user is shown.
 *
 * It existed in exactly one place before this file — SessionEngine.swift, 503
 * lines only macOS can run — and #49 needs the same machine on Windows.
 * Writing it a second time in C++ would give ADR-0004's traffic-gated
 * liveness two implementations to get right, failing differently on two
 * operating systems under load, in a way that looks like a hardware fault.
 * So it is written once, here, and each helper is a transport and a face.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IS HERE AND WHAT IS NOT
 *
 * **Here:** every decision. The state values, both policy predicates, the
 * timings, the backoff, the negotiation, and the frames that go out.
 *
 * `dh_helper_prompts_pair_chord` is the one that is not a presentation
 * choice. The chord provisions whatever is attached to the channel during its
 * window (#34), so a state that offers it while something else holds the
 * channel hands that something else the pairing. It is decided once, not per
 * platform.
 *
 * **Not here:** the wording. A Windows tray tooltip and a macOS menu bar item
 * are not one string table living in C — every output carries a code and its
 * numbers, and each helper says it in its own words. That is also why this
 * file needs no stdio.
 *
 * Also not here: secret *storage*. The decision to store a board key is an
 * output (DH_HELPER_OUT_STORE_BOARD_KEY); whether it lands in DPAPI or a 0600
 * file is the platform's business.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Pure C11: no I/O, no allocation, no clock and no entropy source of its own —
 * time arrives as a millisecond argument and entropy through a callback, so
 * liveness is tested by driving ticks rather than by sleeping.

 * hours, one every 98 s, and later the same shape on Windows at one every
 * ~195 s and on macOS at one every ~17 minutes. Four of those never land
 * inside thirty seconds, so the state line read "Connected and paired" for the
 * whole sixteen hours while the session was rebuilt underneath it.
 *
 * Widening the window above was not the fix. It counts every teardown,
 * disappearances included, so a window long enough to reach 17-minute spacing
 * would also call four ordinary unplugs across an afternoon a flapping link.
 * This one counts only the teardowns *this end* decided on with the device
 * still there — a liveness timeout, a protocol error, a failed write — and is
 * cleared whenever the device goes away, so nothing innocent accumulates in it
 * and the window can be as long as the fault is slow.
 *
 * Three inside three quarters of an hour: the slowest spacing observed puts
 * three of them in ~34 minutes, and three sessions dying over a link that
 * never moved has no benign reading.
 *
 * It takes only teardowns spaced further apart than the whole short window, so
 * a burst contributes one entry and never three, and the two readings answer
 * one fault each instead of the fast one latching the slow one for the rest of

 * are worse. Sessions the board ends on purpose — a wipe, a mode change — are
