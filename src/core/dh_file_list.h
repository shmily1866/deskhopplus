 * deskhopplus shared core — the file list a kind-2 CLIP_OFFER carries (#56).
 *
 * The offer's metadata names the files a transfer is about to deliver and how
 * long each one is. The chunk stream itself carries no boundaries: a file's
 * bytes begin at the sum of the sizes ahead of it, which is the same
 * arithmetic reassembly already does for chunks. So this list is not a
 * convenience — without it the payload is one anonymous run of bytes.
 *
 * Layout, per docs/protocol.md: a UTF-8 JSON array of objects, each with
 * `name` then `size`, in that order, with no escapes anywhere in it. That
 * last part is the point of `dh_file_name_clean` below, and it is what lets
 * the decoder hand out views into the buffer it was given rather than copies.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY NAMES ARE CLEANED ON THE WAY OUT AND CHECKED ON THE WAY IN
 *
 * A name that arrives from the other computer is used to build a path inside
 * this one's temporary directory. `../` in that name is a write to somewhere
 * else entirely, so something on the path has to refuse it.
 *
 * The copy side cleans, because it is the end that still knows what the file
 * was called and can make a name both operating systems will open. The paste
 * side **refuses rather than repairs**: repairing would deliver a file under a
 * name the copy side never sent, which is a quieter kind of wrong, and the far
 * end is not necessarily ours.
 *
 * This is not a fidelity carve-out (ADR-0003). Fidelity is the *content*
 * guarantee — the bytes are byte-identical end to end — and a file name is
 * metadata. Windows cannot hold a name macOS allows, so some mapping exists
 * whatever we do; doing it once, here, is what makes both ends agree on what
 * the mapping was.
