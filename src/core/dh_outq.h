 * deskhopplus shared core — the device's outbound frame queue (#69).
 *
 * Both of the device's outbound seams hand whole frames to a transport that
 * drains them in small fixed units: this board's helper takes 64 bytes per
 * 1 ms HID report, the peer board 8 bytes per inter-board packet. Each seam
 * used to hold exactly one frame and refuse the next outright — and with no
 * retransmit beneath either of them, a refusal was silent truncation. A 4 KiB
 * frame owns a seam for ~64 ms of USB drain, and the 3.6 Mbaud inter-board
 * link completes frames far faster than that, so the collision was the
 * expected case under load rather than an edge. This is the queue both grew.
 *
 * Two bands: a session reply must not wait out a clipboard frame. Behind the
 * bulk band, a bounded FIFO — deep enough to absorb the burst one slow drain
 * creates, and no deeper, because a *sustained* overrun is the credit window's
 * problem and the credit window is end-to-end between helpers, not something
 * the firmware may read (ADR-0003, ADR-0005).
 *
 * The invariant worth stating plainly: at most one frame is ever mid-drain,
 * and it finishes before any other frame's first byte. Both seams feed a
 * reader that recovers frame boundaries from the byte stream alone — the
 * helper's dh_frame_reader, the peer's single dh_relay_rx context — so
 * interleaving two frames desynchronises it. Priority therefore overtakes bulk
 * that is merely queued, never bulk that is in flight.
 *
 * Header bytes only, never payload: the band comes from one comparison on the
 * type byte, which is the whole of what the firmware is allowed to know about
 * a relayed frame.
 *
 * Pure C11, no I/O, no allocation, no locking — a caller reached from two
 * cores locks around it, as channel.c does.

/*
 * A frame waiting behind the one in flight. Sized for the largest bulk frame a
 * transfer can actually complete with — not for the 4 KiB frame maximum, which
 * would cost four times the RAM to hold traffic that never arrives in bursts
 * (ADR-0005):
 *
 *   CLIP_CHUNK  4 + 24 + 40 (DH_SEAL_CHUNK_OVERHEAD) + 1024 (DH_XFER_CHUNK_SIZE) = 1092
 *   CLIP_OFFER  4 + 24 + 43 (DH_SEAL_OFFER_OVERHEAD) + 1024 (DH_XFER_META_MAX)   = 1095
 *
 * The 24 is v2's authentication prefix (#111): it sits inside the frame's
 * length, so every frame this band holds on the helper-facing side grew by it.
 * Missing that would not have failed loudly — an over-long bulk frame is
 * refused as retryable rather than rejected — it would simply have stopped
 * anything queueing *behind* the frame in flight, which is the whole reason
 * this band exists. Frames crossing the inter-board link carry no prefix, so
 * they are 24 bytes smaller and comfortably inside the same bound.
 *
 * The seal (#113) is inside these figures for the same reason the prefix is:
 * what crosses this seam is the sealed body, not the clear one. This bound was
 * stated for the clear sizes while the transfer core had yet to seal anything,
 * and #52 made that untrue without moving it — so from then until #135 a
 * full-size chunk was 24 bytes over the bound and could never queue behind
 * anything at all. Small copies fitted in one short chunk and worked; a
 * clipboard payload past DH_XFER_CHUNK_SIZE lost most of itself, silently,
 * counted only in a field that cannot be read (#133).
 *
 * The offer matters as much as the chunk and is the one that sets this bound.
 * A chunk lost here is re-requested end to end, but there is no retransmit for
 * an offer — its loss costs the whole transfer, out to the helper's timeout —
 * so an offer that cannot queue is the expensive kind of refusal. An offer
 * carrying more metadata than DH_XFER_META_MAX is cancelled by the receiver on
 * arrival, so beyond this bound there is no frame worth reserving space for.
 *
 * outq_test.c pins both figures against the transfer machine's and the seal's
 * own constants, so the firmware need not include either to state its own
 * buffer size — and so that neither can move again without this failing.

/*
 * Frames queued behind the one in flight, so the queue holds four bulk frames
 * in total.
 *
 * Sized to one whole pump batch, which is DH_XFER_CREDIT_WINDOW chunks **plus
 * one**: dh_xfer_pump emits the CLIP_DONE in the same batch as the last chunks
 * and does not credit-gate it. At a depth of two the frame that overflowed was
 * therefore always the DONE, the one frame nothing retransmits, whose loss
 * costs the whole transfer out to the helper's thirty-second timeout (#141).
 *
 * Closing that from the helper side was tried three ways and each broke
 * recovery outright, so the queue is what moved. ADR-0005 keeps this queue
 * deliberately short, and it still is: the argument there is against absorbing
 * a *sustained* overrun, which is the credit window's job, not against holding
 * one batch of it.
 *
 * outq_test pins this against DH_XFER_CREDIT_WINDOW so the two cannot drift.
