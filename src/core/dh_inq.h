 * deskhopplus shared core — the inbound handoff from the peer board (#139).
 *
 * A frame reassembled from the inter-board link is not finished when it
 * arrives. It has to be re-tagged before it reaches this board's helper: the
 * tag is per hop, so it must be written under *this* board's key with *this*
 * board's counter, and both belong to the session, which lives on core 0. The
 * reassembly happens on core 1. So the frame is parked here and core 0 takes
 * it on its next pass.
 *
 * This was one slot, and the justification for one slot was that "a frame
 * takes about 4 ms to arrive over a 3.6 Mbaud link and core 0 drains at
 * 1000 Hz, so a second slot would hold something that is never there." That is
 * true of a full-size CLIP_CHUNK and of nothing else. A relayed CLIP_CREDIT is
 * ten bytes — three inter-board packets, about 100 us — and since the credit
 * window was sized against the outbound queue (#137) the receiver grants one
 * credit per chunk rather than one per eight. So the reverse path now carries
 * short frames in bursts that land several deep inside a single 1 ms tick, and
 * the second slot holds something that is there constantly. Measured on both
 * boards under nothing more than ordinary copying (#139).
 *
 * A dropped frame here is a whole frame. A chunk is re-requested end to end,
 * but a CLIP_OFFER, a CLIP_DONE or a CLIP_CREDIT has no retransmit behind it
 * and costs the entire transfer out to the helper's thirty-second timeout
 * (#78) — the same asymmetry that sizes dh_outq's slots.
 *
 * **Not a transport queue.** dh_outq hands bytes to a drain that takes them in
 * small fixed units, so it tracks progress through the frame in flight. Here a
 * frame is taken whole or not at all, and the only thing that has to be right
 * is that one core may write while the other reads. Hence a plain ring rather
 * than a second copy of dh_outq.
 *
 * Pure C11, no I/O, no allocation, no locking, and **no memory barriers** —
 * see the ordering contract on the four calls below. The caller owns the
 * barrier because the barrier is a platform instruction and this file has no
 * platform.

 * authentication prefix (it is re-tagged on the way out), so it is 24 bytes
 * inside this bound rather than at it, and the negotiated chunk size is
 * clamped to DH_XFER_CHUNK_SIZE on the way down (DH_SESSION_MAX_CHUNK) so it
 * cannot grow past it either.
 *
 * A longer frame is refused and counted rather than carried. That is a real
 * narrowing of what the single full-size slot accepted, and it costs nothing
 * worth keeping: a frame past this bound is one the far board's outbound queue
 * could never queue behind anything either, so it was only ever carried when
 * that queue happened to be idle.
