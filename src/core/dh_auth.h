 * deskhopplus shared core — session keys, the frame tag, and the counter (#110).
 *
 * This is the wire half of ADR-0008 in one file: what a frame's 24-byte
 * authentication prefix is made of, and what a receiver has to decide before
 * it may act on the frame behind it. The layouts are docs/protocol.md v2 and
 * test-vectors/frames.txt is the gate; the primitives underneath are
 * dh_sha256.h and dh_p256.h.
 *
 * The rule this file exists to enforce is per frame, not per session. v1
 * gated relay on one flag for the whole board, so any process writing into a
 * shared endpoint could push bulk into a session it never authenticated
 * (#34, #95). A board holding a live session still drops a frame whose tag
 * does not verify.
 *
 * What it deliberately does not do: decide what to *say* about a failure.
 * Silence on a failed tag, the refusal messages, the listener alert and its
 * threshold are the board's (#111) and the helper's (#112), not the codec's.
 *
 * Pure C11: no allocation, no I/O, no clock, no entropy source.

 * tagged at N can reach the wire behind a heartbeat tagged at N+1. Under a
