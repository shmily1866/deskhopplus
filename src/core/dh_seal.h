 * deskhopplus shared core — the end-to-end clipboard seal (#113).
 *
 * ADR-0008's other half. dh_auth.h authenticates one *hop*: helper to board,
 * board to helper, with the tag rewritten at each end. This file encrypts the
 * bulk payload *end to end*, between the two helpers, so that the boards relay
 * ciphertext and hold no key that opens it. That turns CONTEXT.md's **opaque
 * relay** from a discipline into a property: a board relays bytes it could not
 * read even if it wanted to, which matters because ADR-0007 already accepts
 * that a compromised board can flash its peer.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IS HERE AND WHAT IS NOT
 *
 * **Here:** the seal exchange, the key agreement over it, the counter that
 * feeds the nonce, and the layout of a sealed CLIP_OFFER and CLIP_CHUNK.
 *
 * **Not here: AES-256-GCM.** ADR-0008 chose it because both helpers already
 * have it — CryptoKit on macOS, CNG on Windows — so the cipher arrives through
 * `dh_seal_aead` and this core links none. The board links none either, and
 * more than that: the board never instantiates this file at all. Its primitive
 * set stays SHA-256, HMAC, HKDF and P-256.
 *
 * **Not here: entropy.** The platform supplies the entropy callback used for
 * fresh exchanges; retries need no new material. The explicit-material
 * primitives below also serve deterministic wire-vector tests. A core that cannot be tested
 * deterministically is a core whose security property cannot be tested at all.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * **One seal per direction, established by the sender.** A helper with bulk to
 * send and no live seal offers one; the receiver accepts. Two independent
 * one-directional seals cost one extra ECDH on each helper — a millisecond on
 * a laptop, no board work at all — and remove the whole question of who wins
 * when both sides offer at once. Each helper therefore holds a dh_seal_tx for
 * what it sends and a dh_seal_rx for what it receives.
 *
 * There is no development-build path through this file, and there must never
 * be one. #44's exemption is the *board's*, and the board is not a party to
 * this key.
 *
 * Pure C11: no allocation, no I/O, no clock. Layouts: docs/protocol.md, "The
 * sealed clipboard payload"; test-vectors/frames.txt is the gate.
