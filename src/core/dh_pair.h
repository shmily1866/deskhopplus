/*
 * deskhopplus shared core — the board's identity, and the one helper key it
 * registers (#111, ADR-0008).
 *
 * The threat this answers is stated precisely in #34: the channel is a data
 * bridge between two machines whose isolation is the premise of the project.
 * The firmware relays opaquely, so any local process that opened the channel
 * could push bytes to the other computer, where a helper writes files and
 * sets the clipboard.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT REPLACED THE BEARER TOKEN
 *
 * Until #111 this file held a 16-byte secret that the device handed to a
 * helper during a pairing window and the helper sent back verbatim in every
 * hello. Two properties made that unsound, and both were measured rather than
 * argued (#95, 2026-08-13):
 *
 *   1. On macOS the channel is not reliably exclusive. A second
 *      kIOHIDOptionsTypeSeizeDevice open succeeded and every client received
 *      every report (re-measured 2026-09-14 on macOS 15.7.9: refused, #191 —
 *      which changes nothing here), so a secret that crosses the wire is a
 *      secret anything running as the user can take — with no filesystem
 *      access and no permission of any kind.
 *   2. Rotation therefore did not recover a stolen pairing, it re-issued it.
 *      A listener still attached when the user pressed the chord simply
 *      received the replacement. The documented remedy handed the thief the
 *      new secret.
 *
 * ADR-0008 replaced it with a key pair on each side. **Only public halves
 * cross, at any point, ever**, so there is nothing in the exchange to take:
 *
 *   - The **board's identity** is a P-256 key pair generated on first boot
 *     into its *own flash sector*, beside ADDR_CONFIG and ADDR_FW_RUNNING and
 *     part of neither. It survives a config wipe, a firmware update, and the
 *     peer propagation that copies one board's image onto the other (#91) —
 *     an identity inside the image would give both boards the same identity.
 *   - The **registration** is exactly one helper public key, plus the 32-byte
 *     shared secret from one ECDH against it. It lives in the configuration
 *     and a config wipe clears it, because wiping is how a user unpairs (the
 *     wipe then opens a window, so a helper left running re-pairs). The
 *     identity is not the registration's to take with it: if a wipe took the
 *     identity too, every wipe would make every helper report "this board
 *     changed" — a false alarm on a routine action.
 *
 * The asymmetric work happens **here and nowhere else**. One ECDH at pairing
 * yields the long-term shared secret; every session afterwards is a hash
 * (dh_auth.h). On this chip an ECDH is 133.4 ms, measured on board A under
 * #110, and src/main.c runs six jobs on core 0 in one cooperative loop with no
 * preemption — so it is paid during the pairing window, where the board has
 * just rebooted for the chord and already stalls to write flash.
 *
 * What this does not fix, stated because each was accepted rather than
 * overlooked: there is **no forward secrecy** — flash plus recorded traffic
 * reads the traffic — and a listener that **wins the single-shot pairing
 * race** is registered while the real helper is not. The second is awkward and
 * it is *visible*, which is the detection signal #34 asked for and never got.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Pure C11: no I/O, no clock, no entropy source. A private key is 32 bytes the
 * caller hands in, exactly as the fresh secret used to be, because a core that
 * cannot be tested deterministically is a core whose security property cannot
 * be tested at all.
