 * deskhopplus shared core — the session layer, protocol v2 (#111, ADR-0008).
 *
 * Two things live here, both above framing (dh_frame.h) and below any
 * transport:
 *
 *   1. The body codecs of every session-band message, used by *both* ends, so
 *      the negotiated fields cannot drift between three implementations.
 *   2. The board's side of the session: the hello exchange, the pairing
 *      exchange, per-frame authentication, heartbeat liveness, and the
 *      listener alert.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT V2 CHANGED, AND WHY EACH CHANGE IS HERE
 *
 * **Authorisation is per frame, not per session.** v1 gated relay on one flag
 * for the whole board (`dh_session_may_relay`), so while the legitimate helper
 * held an authenticated session, any other process on the Mac could write a
 * bulk frame and the board relayed it to the other computer — the isolation
 * breach #34 exists to prevent, reachable without ever learning the secret.
 * Every client writes into the same endpoint and the board cannot tell them
 * apart, so a session flag could never have answered "who sent this frame".
 * A tag can. That flag is gone; there is nothing left to gate.
 *
 * **The board is silent when a tag does not verify.** v1 answered
 * DH_HELLO_AUTH_FAILED, that answer reached every attached client because it
 * is an input report, and the real helper read it as "not paired — press the
 * config chord". #108 measured that on hardware: one frame was enough and the
 * state was sticky. Answering is acting, so a failed tag is answered with
 * nothing at all. Two refusals *are* still sent — HELLO_REFUSED(unpaired) and
 * PAIR_REFUSED — because neither can be provoked into saying anything false: a
 * board holding no registration *for the key id a hello names* really is
 * unpaired as far as that asker is concerned, and a board with no window really
 * will not pair. That first test is per key id rather than per board (#117), so
 * that a board registered to *someone else* says so instead of falling silent —
 * silence never reaches the helper state that asks to be paired, which left the
 * pair chord with nothing to provision. docs/protocol.md weighs the widening
 * against the "safe to overhear" argument.
 *
 * **Every answer echoes the caller's correlation value.** A listener can still
 * provoke a genuine refusal, but it carries the *listener's* value and the real
 * helper drops it. Belt and braces with the silence above, because the failure
 * they prevent is a user being told to hand over their pairing.
 *
 * **No asymmetric work per session.** The keys are HKDF over the pairing-time
 * shared secret and a fresh nonce from each side (dh_auth.h). #107 measured 586
 * session teardowns in 16 hours; an ECDH on each would be a 133 ms freeze of the
 * user's own mouse about once every 98 seconds.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Pure C11, no I/O, no clock, no entropy source. Wire format: docs/protocol.md;
 * test-vectors/frames.txt is the gate.
