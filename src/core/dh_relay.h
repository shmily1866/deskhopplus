 * deskhopplus shared core — the inter-board relay (#47).
 *
 * A frame handed to one board arrives intact at the other, having crossed the
 * inter-board serial link, without the firmware ever interpreting its
 * contents. The link carries 8 payload bytes per packet, so a frame is
 * fragmented: a start packet carrying the total length, then data packets
 * each carrying a full 8 bytes — no per-packet sequence number, which on an
 * 8-byte payload would cost 25% on top of the wire's own 33% framing
 * overhead (#32).
 *
 * The only thing read here is the frame header, and only for the two
 * decisions the firmware is allowed to make: which priority band the frame is
 * in, and whether it is well-formed enough to forward. Payloads are opaque —
 * that is what keeps a clipboard format change from ever requiring a device
 * to be reflashed.
 *
 * Pure C11, no I/O, no allocation: the caller owns every buffer.
