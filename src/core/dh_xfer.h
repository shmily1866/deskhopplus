 * How many chunks the receiver lets the sender have outstanding.
 *
 * **It is sized against the board's outbound queue, not against the link.**
 * The board may not read a payload (ADR-0003), so it cannot enforce a credit
 * of its own; dh_outq.h says outright that a *sustained* overrun "is the
 * credit window's problem". This is that window, and it is the only
 * back-pressure the path has.
 *
 * It was 16 while the queue holds one frame in flight and DH_OUTQ_DEPTH behind
 * it. The receiver granted all 16 up front, the sender emitted all 16 in one
 * pump, and everything past the third was refused. A refused chunk is
 * re-requested; a refused CLIP_OFFER or CLIP_DONE has no retransmit and costs
 * the whole transfer out to a thirty-second timeout (#78) — which at the desk
 * is a copy that does not arrive until you make it again (#137). Measured on
 * hardware 2026-08-25: 16 refusals on the receiving board across a handful of
 * copies, once #133 made that counter readable.
 *
 * The queue holds the window **plus one**, not the window: dh_xfer_pump emits
 * the CLIP_DONE in the same batch as the last chunks and does not credit-gate
 * it, so a queue sized to the window alone refuses exactly the frame nothing
 * retransmits. DH_OUTQ_DEPTH is 3 for that reason (#141), and closing the gap
 * from this side instead was tried three ways — a window of 2, a ceiling on
 * accumulated credit, a pump batch capped at 2 — each of which stalls
 * double-loss recovery, because the covering grants that pay for
 * retransmissions are what a cap discards.
 *
 * Three is not a throughput figure either. The drain is the bottleneck at
 * ~64 KB/s, and three chunks outstanding covers about 48 ms of it — more than
 * a credit's round trip, so the sender still never waits. What it stops is the
 * sender running four times ahead of a seam that then throws the difference
 * away. outq_test pins it against DH_OUTQ_DEPTH so the two cannot drift apart
 * again; raising it means deepening that queue first, which costs board RAM
 * and a flash.
