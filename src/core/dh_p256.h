 * deskhopplus shared core — P-256 key pairs and ECDH (#110).
 *
 * The curve is not a preference. ADR-0008 records that the macOS helper's
 * key lives in the Secure Enclave, which does P-256 and nothing else, and
 * that a private key a same-user process could read out of a file would undo
 * the whole wire fix. Key storage chose the curve; the board follows it.
 *
 * Public keys are 64 raw bytes, X || Y, big-endian — micro-ecc's native form
 * and CryptoKit's `rawRepresentation`, so no end adds or strips an X9.63
 * `0x04` prefix (docs/protocol.md, "Identities").
 *
 * No allocation, no I/O, no clock, and no entropy source: a private key is
 * 32 bytes the caller hands in, exactly as dh_pair_open_window already takes
 * its fresh secret. A core that cannot be tested deterministically is a core
 * whose security property cannot be tested at all.
