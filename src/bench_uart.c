/*
 * A measure-only build: what the inter-board UART actually carries (#166).
 *
 * NOT part of the product. Compiled only when the firmware is configured with
 * -DDH_BENCH_UART=ON, and the resulting image is a measuring instrument, not
 * something to leave on a board — it types into whatever has focus and it
 * floods the inter-board link with nonsense.
 *
 * Why it exists: every statement about the inter-board link is arithmetic. 3686400 baud
 * and 8 payload bytes per 12 wire bytes give ~200 KB/s, ADR-0002 reasons
 * from that figure in three places, and nobody has observed it. #39 measured
 * the whole path at 33 KB/s and found the USB hop is the wall, so the UART
 * has never been under load.
 *
 * Both boards run this image. Each one:
 *
 *   1. settles, then sends one hello a second until a bench packet arrives
 *      from the peer board — which is how it learns the peer board is on this
 *      image too, and why the flood cannot start while it is still pulling it;
 *   2. floods: keeps uart_tx_queue topped up with BENCH_UART_PACKETS numbered
 *      packets, as fast as the queue drains;
 *   3. counts what arrives from the peer board's flood, on core 1, in the handler
 *      that process_packet already dispatches to — so the receive path under
 *      test is the product's own, checksum and all;
 *   4. waits for both floods to finish, then types one line. Board B is a
 *      keyboard on the Windows machine, so both halves can be read without a
 *      cable trip.
 *
 * The two floods overlap. The inter-board link is full duplex, transmit is core 0's DMA
 * and receive is core 1's ring, so neither direction takes from the other,
 * and both boards talking at once is the condition the relay runs in.
 *
 * Usage is in tools/board-checks/README.md.
