# DeskHopPlus Adversarial Review

Use this post-implementation review to answer: *now that the change works, what else did it expose, break, or make reachable?* DeskHopPlus is embedded firmware and a distributed protocol system; happy-path correctness is insufficient.

Use only after normal code review is complete. Skip genuinely trivial documentation, comment, or formatting-only changes. Fix every retained finding in this same turn, the way code-review findings are fixed before the commit. A finding leaves this turn as a separate ticket only when it needs a grilling session before anyone can write the fix (step 4).

## 1. Establish the review surface

Confirm the reviewed change and its baseline: the linked issue, reviewed diff/commit range, and test and code-review evidence. Do not treat unrelated worktree changes as part of the review. If normal code review is incomplete, stop and request that it be completed first.

Before exploring the implementation, read `CONTEXT.md`, then the ADRs relevant to the changed area, following `docs/agents/domain.md`. Use the repository's terms in findings and explicitly surface ADR conflicts.

Identify each changed subsystem, its state ownership, inputs/outputs, and affected peers. For each affected path, trace:

```text
input -> state change -> queue/buffer -> protocol/wire -> remote state -> ack/retry/timeout -> observable result
```

## 2. Select the investigation routes

Read only the references that apply:

- For queues, backpressure, retry, timeout, heartbeat, resource limits, or timing, read [reliability and liveness](references/reliability-and-liveness.md).
- For state machines, reconnect/reset, IDs, messages, protocol compatibility, or USB/HID, read [state, protocol, and USB](references/state-protocol-usb.md).
- For communication or traffic changes, read [boundaries and load](references/boundaries-and-load.md).

For every relevant boundary, inspect both directions. Do not infer symmetry from the changed direction.

## 3. Investigate candidates

Use three lenses: **same-path failure** (another failure in the modified path), **adjacent-seam failure** (a neighbor mishandles an otherwise correct result), and **emergent failure** (reasonable components interact into failure). Prefer boundary, lifecycle, and sustained-load candidates over duplicates of normal code-review findings.

For each candidate, attempt to disprove it before retaining it. Classify retained findings as exactly one of:

- **CONFIRMED** — a test, reproduction, trace, or other executable evidence demonstrates it.
- **PROVEN BY CODE** — it follows deterministically from code and its invariants.
- **HARDWARE / ENVIRONMENT DEPENDENT** — the code establishes the failure mode, but physical hardware, OS behavior, or timing is needed to reproduce it.
- **SPECULATION** — insufficient evidence; discard it and never create an issue for it.

Investigate at least two credible additional candidates, spanning two lenses when applicable. Do not manufacture findings: if fewer than two survive, document the routes examined and why no other credible defect was established.

## 4. Fix or defer each finding

For each retained finding, capture the affected subsystem, violated behavior or invariant, exact code path, proof/reproduction, expected and actual behavior, impact, classification, related change/issue, and hardware-verification need.

Then take the first route that applies:

1. **Fix it now** — the default. Write the test that demonstrates the finding, make it pass, and carry the fix into the same commit as the reviewed change. This covers every finding whose fix stays inside the changed subsystems and needs no decision the user has not already made. A HARDWARE / ENVIRONMENT DEPENDENT finding with a small fix is still fixed now; the hardware step only verifies it, so record the verification need on the issue being closed.
2. **Defer to a ticket** — only when the fix needs a grilling session first: it needs a new ADR or conflicts with an existing one, it changes the wire protocol or a persisted format, it reaches into a subsystem the reviewed change did not touch, or the right fix depends on a product decision the user has not made. Search existing `myn/deskhopplus` issues for the same underlying defect before drafting a new one. Follow `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` and `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`. Unless the user has authorized GitHub writes, provide an issue-ready finding for approval rather than creating the issue.

Every finding ends fixed or deferred; a finding that is only recorded is unfinished work.
