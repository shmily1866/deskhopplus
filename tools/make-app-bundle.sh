# Wrap the Mac helper binary in a .app bundle (#206).
#
#   ./tools/make-app-bundle.sh <binary> <out-dir>
#
# Writes <out-dir>/deskhopplus-helper.app and, around it, the zip a user
# downloads, <out-dir>/deskhopplus-helper-macos.zip. Versioned from
# src/core/dh_version.h like everything else that shows a number (#199).
#
# A .app is a folder of a fixed shape: Contents/Info.plist and the binary
# under Contents/MacOS. Finder opens a plain Mach-O in a Terminal window and a
# .app as an app, which is the whole point; LSUIElement keeps it out of the
# Dock as well, on top of the .accessory policy main.swift sets.
#
# Ad-hoc signed (`-s -`): a seal with no identity behind it, so no Developer
# Program and no notarization (#197 decision 5). Gatekeeper still refuses the
# download the first time and the README's Open Anyway step stays. The seal is
# for the arm64 kernel, which refuses to run an unsealed binary at all, and it
# covers every slice of the universal binary and the plist alike. Nothing is
# nested (no frameworks, no helpers), so signing the .app signs it all.
#
# CFBundleName carries the product's own spelling, DeskHopPlus Helper (#232).
# What Finder shows is the file name, which stays lowercase: macOS ignores a
# CFBundleDisplayName that differs from the name on disk, so there is no key
# that changes the label under the icon without renaming the bundle.
#
# The zip is made here too, so CI ships and the test checks one artefact.
# Info-ZIP keeps the mode bits, and the seal lives inside the files, so what
# a user unzips still verifies and runs.
#
# Run by the helper CI job on the release binary, and by hand on a local build
# to try the .app before a tag.
