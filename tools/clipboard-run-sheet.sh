# The clipboard's hardware run sheet (#56), because the last one was done by
# hand and written up by hand, and both halves of that are avoidable.
#
#   ./tools/clipboard-run-sheet.sh files     make the fixtures, once
#   ./tools/clipboard-run-sheet.sh mark      draw a line under the logs, before a sitting
#   ./tools/clipboard-run-sheet.sh sheet     print the steps to work through
#   ./tools/clipboard-run-sheet.sh watch     follow both logs and say what happens
#   ./tools/clipboard-run-sheet.sh report    what the logs say about the last run
#   ./tools/clipboard-run-sheet.sh throughput how fast each set actually moved
#   ./tools/clipboard-run-sheet.sh selftest   check the timing reader itself
#
# `throughput` is the answer to #39. It times each set from the moment the
# receiving helper asked for it to the moment it arrived whole, so the number
# comes out of the same log the sitting already produces — no stopwatch, and
# no arithmetic done by hand afterwards.
#
# `watch` is the one that matters. It reads both helpers' logs at once and
# turns them into one ordered line per event, so a sitting produces its own
# write-up. It also names the failures that are already known, because
# recognising one on the spot is the difference between finishing the sheet and
# spending the evening on a bug someone already filed.
#
# It reads logs and writes fixtures. It never touches the device, the config or
# either helper — every gesture in the sheet is yours, because every one of
# them is a thing only a person at two computers can do.

${bold}The clipboard run sheet — #56${off}

Fixtures: $FIXTURES   (run '$0 files' first)
Run '$0 mark' first, so the counts cover this sitting only.
Start '$0 watch' in another window. It will say what each step did.

${bold}Before anything${off}
  0. Both helpers deployed and running. The watch window should show both
     reaching ${green}Connected and paired${off}. If the Mac shows repeated
     assertion lines and never "started", it is not running at all.

${bold}Mac to Windows${off}
  1. quiet-200K.bin        expect: arrives, ${bold}no question${off}
  2. quiet-400K.bin        expect: arrives, ${bold}still no question${off}
                           (the line is 1 MB — a set under it never asks)
  3. set-of-three/         copy all three files together
                           expect: one question, all three arrive, the empty
                           one is empty and the third is not truncated
  4. progress-5M.bin       expect: one question, progress moves, arrives
  5. progress-5M.bin       accept, then ${bold}cancel${off} partway
                           expect: nothing arrives, nothing partial on disk
  6. over-10mb-cap.bin     expect: ${bold}refused, no question at all${off}
  7. a screenshot          (CleanShot, Cmd-Shift-4 — anything)
                           expect: pastes into ${bold}Paint${off} as a picture,
                           not into Explorer as a .png file
  8. twenty-files/         copy all twenty
                           expect: refused on the copy side with a line about
                           the names not fitting one offer — ${bold}not${off} silence

${bold}Windows to Mac${off} — the same seven, the other way. The Mac's question is
  a panel near the menu bar with Accept and Decline on it.

${bold}The size cap${off}
  9. Set the cap to 2 MB on the config page (field ${bold}Clipboard size cap (MB)${off}),
     on ${bold}both boards${off}.
 10. over-2mb-cap.bin      expect: ${bold}refused, no question${off}
 11. quiet-400K.bin        expect: still works
 12. Put the cap back to 10.

${bold}Lifecycle${off}
 13. Copy files, accept, and while they are arriving pull the USB cable.
     expect: the transfer is abandoned, nothing partial is pasteable
 14. Copy a set on the Mac and ${bold}ignore${off} the question for two minutes.
     expect: it is declined for you, and the link goes quiet
 15. With files on the clipboard, restart a helper, then paste.
     expect: the files are still there

${bold}Throughput — #39${off}
 16. Run '$0 mark' now, so the timings cover this sitting only.
 17. throughput-10M.bin, Mac to Windows. ${bold}Move the mouse the whole time${off}
     and type into something.
     expect: it arrives; the cursor does not stutter
 18. throughput-10M.bin, Windows to Mac. Same again, mouse moving.
     expect: it arrives; the cursor does not stutter
 19. '$0 throughput'
     This prints the per-set rate for each direction, the sustained rate over
     sets above 1 MB, and what that extrapolates to at 64 MB.
     Two columns answer whether bulk hurt anything else while it ran:
     'worst beat gap' is the heartbeat starving (#144), and 'priority refused'
     is how many priority frames the board turned away across the set. A zero
     or a dash in both is the good answer.

# The timing reader, as an awk program both log formats go through. The Mac
# helper stamps a wall clock and the Windows one stamps milliseconds of
# uptime, so `fmt` says which to read; everything after that is common.
#
# A set is timed from the line where the receiving helper asked for it
# ("were accepted here and asked for", or "taken without asking" when it was
# under the no-question line) to the line where it "arrived whole". Byte count
# is the join key, because it is the only thing both lines carry.
#
# Newest accept first, deliberately. A set that was accepted and never arrived
# — an eviction (#161) — otherwise stays at the front of the queue and gets
# paired with the *next* run of the same size, which reads as a transfer that
# took three quarters of an hour. Pairing the newest is right because only one
# set is ever in flight; the accepts left over at the end are counted and
