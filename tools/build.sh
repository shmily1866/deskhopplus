# It always ends by printing what it produced and whether that is what is
# actually deployed, because both artifacts have a way of appearing to build
# fine while changing nothing:
#
#   Firmware -- board B pulls from board A on a strictly newer version, or on
#   an equal version carrying a different image (#91). So a rebuild reaches
#   both boards without a version bump, but a *downgrade* still needs the
#   number to move, and board A never follows B at all. See
#   docs/verification/vendor-hid-interface.md.
#
#   Helper -- launchd holds the binary it started with, so a rebuild is not a
#   deploy. A helper started before a wire-format change ran against newer
#   firmware for two days, failing every frame it was sent, while every rebuild
#   reported success (#93).

# started before a fix reached the tree ran against newer firmware for two
# days, failing every frame it was sent, ~1.4 teardowns a second, while every
# rebuild reported success and changed nothing.
#
# So report the three things a green build cannot tell you: where the agent
# points, whether anything is there, and whether what is running predates what
# was just built.

# One field of the loaded job, as launchd reports it: "path" is the plist it
# was bootstrapped from, "program" the binary it runs. Empty when no job is
# loaded. Anchored so that "stderr path =" does not match "path". The
# `|| true` is what makes "empty" true: with no job, launchctl exits 113, and
# under pipefail that status would end the report at the first assignment.
