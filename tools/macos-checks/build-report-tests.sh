# build.sh's helper report must ask launchd whether the agent is up, not the
# filesystem (#192): a job bootstrapped from a plist outside ~/Library/LaunchAgents
# was reported as "not installed" with "one in the foreground", so the kickstart
# reminder from #93 never appeared and the job kept running the old binary.
#
# A fake launchctl stands in for launchd. The plist it names is never created:
# the /tmp copy in #192 was gone by the next day while the job it bootstrapped
# was still running, so launchd has to answer for the binary as well. The
# binary is dated in the future so the running process predates the build,
# which is #93's exact trap.
