# make-app-bundle.sh must turn a bare binary into a .app that macOS opens as
# an app (#206): Finder runs a plain Mach-O in a Terminal window, and that is
# what the v1.0 zip gave a stranger on first run. The .app is what Gatekeeper
# and launchd see, so the checks here are theirs: plutil for the plist,
# codesign for the ad-hoc seal, and one run of the binary from inside the
# .app, which an arm64 kernel refuses when the seal is missing. The same
# checks run again on what unzip gives back, because the zip is what ships.
