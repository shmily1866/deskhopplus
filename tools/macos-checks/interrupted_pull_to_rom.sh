# #92 criterion 2: can an interrupted pull leave a part-written image running?
#
#   sudo ./tools/macos-checks/interrupted_pull_to_rom.sh check
#   sudo ./tools/macos-checks/interrupted_pull_to_rom.sh run
#
# It flashes board A older than board B so A becomes the receiver, waits for
# the pull to start, has you unplug B, and times the landing. `peer_fw` goes
# stale after 3 s and the stall lands 30 s after the last progress, so a board
# that is going to ROM should be there by about 33 s.
#
# THIS ONE IS DESTRUCTIVE BY DESIGN. It ends with board A in the ROM
# bootloader, which is the pass. Recovery is one picotool load, and the script
# prints it.
#
# The reason it is a script and not a checklist is the evidence. Two paths
# reach the ROM bootloader and they mean opposite things:
#
#   recover_to_rom   erases the first sector       the image was dirty and the
#                                                  peer had gone — the pass
#   reset_usb_boot   erases nothing, image intact  the chord, or a peer message
#
# `picotool save` before reflashing is the only thing that tells them apart,
# and a `picotool load` destroys it. That has already been lost once. So the
# save happens here, automatically, before anything else — and the script reads
# the first sector back and says which path ran.
#
# Needs root. Run it from a real terminal: the `!` prefix in a Claude Code
# session has no TTY for the sudo password prompt.
