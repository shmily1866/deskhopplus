// What a listener attached to the channel can still make the real helper say.
// (#108 on v1; re-pointed at v2 by #114; at v3's report shape by #189.)
//
// #95 measured that a second kIOHIDOptionsTypeSeizeDevice open succeeds and
// receives session traffic (2026-08-13; on macOS 15.7.9 it is refused instead,
// #191, and this probe cannot attach — check there before a run). On protocol
// v1 this probe then measured the
// consequence that mattered, and confirmed it on hardware on 2026-08-18:
//
//   1. A listener sends a HELLO carrying a token it made up.
//   2. The device answers DH_HELLO_AUTH_FAILED — correctly, for that hello.
//   3. That answer is an *input report*, so every attached client receives it.
//   4. The real helper, with no field tying an answer to the question that
//      asked it, believed it and told the user "Not paired — press the config
//      chord" — #34's losing sequence of 2026-08-10, with no race won.
//
// ADR-0008 closed that, and this probe now measures whether it stayed closed.
// It asks two questions of a v3 board, in one run:
//
//   A. THE TRAP. A hello whose tag is wrong carries the *probe's* correlation
//      value, so every answer to it carries the probe's value too. The real
//      helper acts only on an answer carrying its own. Expected: the probe
//      sees the answer, and the helper's state does not move.
//
//   B. THE STATE THAT REPLACED "channel held". The board counts frames it
//      could not authenticate and reports the rate as LISTENER_ALERT (#111),
//      which the helper surfaces as "Another program is writing to the device
//      channel" (#114). Expected: a handful of bad-tag heartbeats inside one
//      window produce that alert on the wire and that line in the helper's log.
//
// A is a negative result and B is a positive one, which is the point of running
// them together: a run where the helper says nothing at all proves A only if B
// shows the helper was listening and could still be moved.
//
// They run in sequence, not at once — hellos for the first few seconds, then
// nothing but heartbeats. A hello the board answers is a queued frame, and a
// queued frame every beat interval suppresses the device heartbeat and takes the
// real session down with it (#118). Frames arriving with no session are
// deliberately not counted towards the alert, so overlapping the two would have
// question A destroy the session question B needs and B would read "no alert" on
// a board doing exactly the right thing.
//
// Both are read out of the helper's own log as well as off the wire, so the
// whole measurement is one command: a run sheet step that needs a human
// watching two things at once is how #75 and #100 both hid.
//
// Non-destructive in the sense that matters — nothing is written to flash and no
// pairing moves. The session may be torn down and rebuilt during the hello
// phase; that is #118, and it is reported rather than hidden.
//
// Usage:
//   swift probe_manufactured_chord_trap.swift [--seconds N] [--interval MS]
//                                             [--hello-seconds N] [--once]
//                                             [--log PATH]
//
// --seconds must outlast --hello-seconds plus the board's listener window
// (DH_LISTENER_WINDOW_MS, 10 s) or question B cannot be answered: the alert is
// raised when the window closes, not when the frames arrive.
