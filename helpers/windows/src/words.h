 * The wording, which is the half of every output the shared core deliberately
 * does not carry (#80, #85). `dh_helper` emits a code and its numbers —
 * `DH_NOTE_LISTENER_DETECTED, a = 4, b = 10000` — and each helper says it in
 * its own words; a Windows tray tooltip and a macOS menu bar item are not one
 * string table living in C.
 *
 * The session state, config-chord permission, and bulk permission come from
 * the core. The Windows presence view below also uses the transport mode to
 * clear a stale connected config label during the core's USB-noise debounce.
 * The chord predicate carries a security property (#34) and is called,
 * never re-read.
 *
 * The rule the note codes exist to protect: **a note never loses its
 * numbers**. A rate reported without the rate is what let #94 run for two
 * days, so every case that has an `a` or a `b` spends it.
 *
 * The macOS twins are HelperState.swift and HelperNotes.swift.
