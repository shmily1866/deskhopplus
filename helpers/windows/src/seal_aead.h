/*
 * This helper's half of the clipboard seal (#113, ADR-0008): AES-256-GCM,
 * from CNG.
 *
 * Everything that decides *what* is sealed, under which key and with which
 * nonce is in the shared core (`dh_seal.h`), for the reason the session
 * machine is there too: a rule both helpers must agree on cannot have two
 * implementations to drift between. All that is left for a platform is the
 * cipher, and ADR-0008 chose AES-256-GCM because both platforms already have
 * it — so nothing here is hand-written crypto, and the firmware links no
 * cipher at all.
 *
 * bcrypt is already on ADR-0006's list of inbox libraries, for
 * BCryptGenRandom; this uses the same one.
 *
 * ChaCha20-Poly1305 would have been the other candidate and was rejected for
 * exactly this file: CNG only offers it on Windows 11, and #84 targets a
 * managed laptop.
