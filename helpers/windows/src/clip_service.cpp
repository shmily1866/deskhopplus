             * — the largest cap the board can state — peaks at roughly that.
             * The read happens on the window thread, which also carries the
             * heartbeat: at SSD speeds that is tens of milliseconds against a
             * three-second deadline, and input itself never touches this
             * helper, so what a long read could cost is one late cursor
             * placement. Streaming from disk instead would mean the transfer
             * core holding a callback rather than a pointer, which is a change
             * to the shared machine both helpers run.
