 * The clipboard path, from a local copy to a frame body and back (#52).
 *
 * Everything it decides is already decided elsewhere: what a transfer does is
 * `dh_xfer`, what a seal does is `dh_seal`, and whether a direction is allowed
 * is the board's. What this file owns is the *joining* of those three — which
 * seal a payload waits on, which message carries which action, and what happens
 * to a transfer when a toggle changes underneath it.
 *
 * No Win32 here at all, which is the point: the clipboard itself
 * (clipboard.cpp) is the only file that touches the API, and everything that
 * can be got wrong about ordering, credit and seals is reachable by a test.
 *
 * The macOS twin is ClipboardService.swift. Two of these existing is
 * deliberate, and it is the same trade HelperSession already makes: the rules
 * both ends must agree on have one implementation in the shared core, and only
 * the joining is written twice. Two *transfer machines* would have given the
 * credit window and the received-set two chances to be got right.
 *
 * Single-threaded by construction, like the rest of the helper.
