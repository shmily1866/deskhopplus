/*
 * Where the helper keeps its identity and the board it is paired with (#84).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT DPAPI HERE DOES AND DOES NOT PROTECT — stated plainly, because a user
 * who is misled about this makes worse decisions than one who is told nothing.
 *
 * **Does:** binds every stored blob to this Windows user account on this
 * machine. Copying the files to another machine, or to another account on this
 * one, yields bytes that will not unprotect. That is the property being
 * bought, and it is bought with no signature, no elevation and no prompt —
 * which is why it fits a portable unsigned exe where the macOS helper's
 * reasoning does not (Keychain access control keys off a code signature this
 * helper does not have; see SecretStore.swift).
 *
 * **Does not:** defend against a process running as the same user. Anything
 * with this account's token can call CryptUnprotectData on these files and
 * read the private key out. There is no Secure Enclave equivalent here — the
 * macOS helper's key is non-extractable and this one is not, and that
 * asymmetry is real rather than something the wording should smooth over.
 *
 * The mitigation that does apply is **rotation**: a fresh chord press
 * registers a new key with the board and the old one stops being accepted
 * (#46). Re-pairing genuinely revokes.
 *
 * **No optional entropy**, deliberately. A constant salt compiled into an exe
 * published from CI is readable by anyone who has the exe, so it would read as
 * protection while providing none — which is worse than having none. Entropy
 * is only worth passing when it is itself a secret, and there is nowhere here
 * to keep one that is not already this file's problem.
 *
 * CRYPTPROTECT_UI_FORBIDDEN throughout: this runs in the notification area
 * with no window worth blocking, and a modal credential prompt from a
 * background helper is a prompt the user cannot attribute to anything.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * What is *not* stored: any shared secret. The helper re-derives it by ECDH
 * each session and never keeps it.
