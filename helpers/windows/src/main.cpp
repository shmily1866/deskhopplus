 * The Windows helper: a single portable exe that finds the device, seizes
 * every channel, introduces itself, keeps the session alive (#49), and carries
 * the clipboard across it (#52).
 *
 * Clipboard text, images and files (#52, #55, #56); cursor placement is #53. Nothing needs installing: see helpers/windows/README.md
 * and ADR-0006.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE LOOP, AND WHY IT IS ONE THREAD
 *
 * Device events arrive as WM_DEVICECHANGE on this window. Reports arrive as
 * overlapped read completions. MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx waits on both at
 * once, so they are handled in arrival order on the thread that owns the
 * window — the same thread the tray and (later) clipboard ownership must run
 * on anyway. The shared core assumes a single-threaded caller. There is
 * nothing here to lock, and that is a decision rather than an accident.
 *
 * Nothing in this file decides anything about the session. Every decision is
 * src/core/dh_helper.c, reached through HelperSession. This file carries
 * messages and owns the clock. What each output *means* is output_dispatch.cpp,
 * so that every arm of it is reachable by a test (#152); this file is the Win32
 * half of that seam.
