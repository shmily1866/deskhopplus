/*
 * The autostart ladder's *decisions*, with no Win32 in them (#86).
 *
 * This split is the point of the slice. Autostart on a managed laptop fails in
 * ways that are not predictable from the outside — a logon task the policy
 * refuses, a run key an agent strips, a startup folder that is redirected —
 * so the helper tries three mechanisms in order and takes the first that
 * works. That logic is the code most likely to be wrong on a machine nobody
 * can reproduce, and none of it needs a registry to be worth checking.
 *
 * The platform calls sit behind this in autostart.h and are not reached by
 * tests, which is the same line ChannelTransport.swift draws on the other
 * helper.
 *
 * Header-only and dependency-free so the test executable links nothing
 * (ADR-0006).

 * delay. The run key is second: cheap, per-user, needs nothing. The startup
 * folder is last because it is the most visible to the user and the most
 * easily "tidied up" by something else — which makes it the best fallback and
