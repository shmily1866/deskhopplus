/*
 * The notification-area icon and its menu (#85) — what the user can see
 * without opening a log.
 *
 * On the helper's own message-only window, and on the one thread everything
 * else runs on. mkroamer's tray gave itself a thread and a mutex because its
 * agent was multi-threaded; here the transport, the session and the tray are
 * all on the window thread, so there is nothing to marshal and nothing to
 * lock.
 *
 * Three rules the core does not carry, because they are presentation:
 *
 *   - **The icon is always there** (#208, and #54's first criterion). It
 *     takes one of three looks — paired, off, attention (`words::look`) — and
 *     the quiet state is the *off* look, not a missing icon: a device that
 *     disappears for a moment is ordinary USB noise, and config mode is
 *     something the user did, so neither look is alarming. While a file
 *     arrives the icon is the percent, drawn as two digits.
 *   - **A balloon fires only for a state that names a remedy.** Everything
 *     else changes the tooltip silently. Ordinary reconnection is not an event
 *     worth interrupting anyone for, and a balloon per reconnect is how a
 *     helper teaches its user to ignore it.
 *   - **The icon asks to sit on the taskbar, not in the overflow.** See
 *     `promote`.
 *
 * The wording and the look are words.h's. What the *states* are, and whether
 * the pair chord may be offered from one, are the shared core's and are
 * called rather than restated (#34).
