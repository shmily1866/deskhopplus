/*
 * The Win32 side of autostart (#86) — the three mechanisms, their readbacks,
 * and where the record is kept between runs.
 *
 * Every *decision* is autostart_ladder.h, which has no Win32 in it and is
 * covered by tests. This file is the platform underneath: it does what the
 * ladder says and reports what happened.
 *
 * Opt-in from the tray menu, never automatic on first run. A portable exe that
 * silently writes a logon task is a surprise the user did not ask for.
 *
 * The self-heal is the part that matters for a file the user can drag
 * somewhere else: every entry names the helper's *own* current location
 * (GetModuleFileNameW) and is rewritten whenever it stops matching. mkroamer's
 * autostart.h chose the Startup folder for exactly this reason; the ladder
 * keeps that and adds the fallbacks a managed laptop needs.
