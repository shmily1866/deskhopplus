/*
 * What each output *does* — the shim's two switches, with the platform behind
 * an interface (#152).
 *
 * Both services below it are covered in depth: `HelperSession` binds the
 * shared core, `ClipService` joins the seal to the transfer, and both have
 * their own suites. The layer that turns each of their outputs into a real
 * effect had none, so every arm was correct by reading only — a service could
 * be proved to emit the right output while the shim dropped it, called the
 * wrong thing, or fell through. That is the shape of #93 and #94: a helper
 * that reports healthy while doing nothing.
 *
 * No Win32 here, which is the point. The tray, the HID transport, the
 * clipboard and the secret store stay in main.cpp behind `HelperEffects`, and
 * this file only decides which of them an output reaches. The wording is
 * words.h's, as everywhere else.
 *
 * The macOS twin is OutputDispatch.swift, and the two are deliberately the
 * same shape — a divergence between them is a clipboard that works on one
 * computer and not the other. One arm is not the same, and by decision: the
 * State arm here checks `words::state_is_known` and drives a tray, and macOS
 * does neither *here*. It makes the same check one layer up — HelperSession
 * turns a state its wording has no case for into a note before it becomes an
 * output at all — and it has no notification-area icon to update.
 *
 * Single-threaded by construction, like the rest of the helper.
