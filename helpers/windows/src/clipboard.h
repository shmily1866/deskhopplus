/*
 * This computer's clipboard: what was copied here, and what arrives from the
 * other computer (#52, #55, #56).
 *
 * Text, images and files are carried. A file copy is read as a *list* and not
 * as bytes — the contents are not touched until the other computer's user
 * accepts the transfer, which is the whole of #56 and the reason `local_files`
 * hands over a callable rather than a payload.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS LIVES ON THE HELPER'S OWN WINDOW, AND NOT A THREAD OF ITS OWN
 *
 * Setting clipboard data requires being the clipboard owner, which requires a
 * window handle — so a console-only helper is ruled out (spec #42). The helper
 * already has a message-only window for WM_DEVICECHANGE, and it already runs
 * everything on the thread that owns it. Attaching here rather than starting a
 * second thread keeps that true: the shared core assumes one caller, and there
 * is nothing to lock.
 *
 * A message-only window does not receive *broadcast* messages, but
 * WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE is sent to listeners registered with
 * AddClipboardFormatListener rather than broadcast, so it arrives.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WINDOWS DELAYED RENDERING FOR LAZY IMAGES
 *
 * A large image is claimed with a null handle and requested from the copy side
 * only when WM_RENDERFORMAT says an application pasted it. The handler pumps
 * the channel and window messages while it waits, bounded by the measured
 * 49 KB/s route plus margin, so the helper remains live during the synchronous
 * Win32 callback. Text and small images remain eager and always publish real
 * handles immediately.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * OPENING THE CLIPBOARD CAN FAIL
 *
 * OpenClipboard fails outright when another window holds it, with no built-in
 * wait, so every access here is a bounded retry with a widening delay. A single
 * failed attempt would drop a payload that has already crossed the link,
 * silently.
