 * The helper's side of the session — as a **binding onto the shared core's

 *
 * Nothing here decides anything. The hello exchange, negotiation, ADR-0004's
 * liveness, pairing, all-or-nothing acquisition, the capped backoff and the
 * states a user is shown are all src/core/dh_helper.c — the same object code
 * the firmware compiles and the macOS helper drives. This file carries events
 * in, carries outputs back, and owns the two halves the core deliberately
 * refuses: the *wording* (words.h) and the platform's key storage.
 *
 * The macOS twin is HelperSession.swift. Two of these existing is the point:
 * two *machines* would have given ADR-0004's traffic-gated liveness two
 * chances to be got right, failing differently on two operating systems under
 * load, in a way that looks like a hardware fault.
 *
 * Single-threaded by construction, like the rest of the helper — the core
 * assumes one caller and there is nothing here to lock.
