 * The Win32 end of the channel: find the device, seize every channel or none,
 * carry reports in and out.
 *
 * It decides nothing. It reports what it sees to the session and does what the
 * session asks — and the session is itself only a binding onto the shared
 * core's machine (helper_session.h). The macOS twin is ChannelTransport.swift.
 *
 * **One thread.** Discovery is a SetupAPI sweep, driven by WM_DEVICECHANGE on
 * the helper's message-only window and by the run loop's own idle rescan;
 * reads are overlapped and their events are pumped alongside that window's
 * messages. CM_Register_Notification would call
 * back on a pool thread and need marshalling for no gain, and clipboard
 * ownership pins work to the window thread regardless. There is nothing here
 * to lock (#49).
 *
 * Win32 handle operations need device verification. Collection matching and
 * discovery decisions have a host-runnable test; the autostart ladder has
 * its own decision test too.

       answer: a board that reboots comes back on a new device path, and a
       sweep landing in the middle of Windows building those nodes sees
       nothing and records a departure. That verdict then stood for ever,

       which sweeps unconditionally in start() — could correct it. That was
       #157, confirmed with the device reported OK by Windows while this held
       no channel at all. Repeating the sweep costs one SetupAPI enumeration
