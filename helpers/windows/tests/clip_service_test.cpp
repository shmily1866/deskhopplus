/*
 * The clipboard payload path (#52, #55), driven as **two helpers talking to each
 * other** rather than one talking to a script.
 *
 * That is the whole value of the shape. Every rule these exercise — the seal
 * exchange, the credit window, the received-set, abandon-on-drop — is the
 * shared core's, and a test where one end answers a mock of the other would be
 * checking the mock. Here a copy made on one side is carried, frame by frame,
 * through a relay that does nothing but hand bytes over, and the check is that
 * the bytes come out the far side identical.
 *
 * The board is not modelled, deliberately. Between two helpers it is an opaque
 * relay that holds no key and reads no payload (ADR-0008), so a hop that hands
 * bytes over unchanged is exactly what one is.
 *
 * Windows only, because the cipher is: ClipService takes the platform's AEAD
 * and this suite gives it the one the helper actually ships. The macOS twin is
 * helpers/macos/Tests/channel-tests/ClipboardTests.swift, and the two check the
 * same claims — that is the point of both existing.
 *
 * Style follows seal_test.cpp — an assertion macro, a main, a printed failure
 * line, a non-zero exit. No framework (ADR-0006).
