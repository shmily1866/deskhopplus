/*
 * When a pasteboard poll has actually seen a copy (#132 follow-up).
 *
 * macOS has no copy notification, so the helper polls `changeCount`. That
 * count is bumped by `clearContents` / `prepareForNewContents` — *before* a
 * single byte is written — so a poll can land inside a copy that has not
 * finished yet and read nothing at all.
 *
 * Recording the count on that first look, as this used to, meant nothing ever
 * looked again: the copy was dropped in silence, and the user saw a copy that
 * sometimes crossed and sometimes did not. Only this direction had the
 * problem. The Windows helper is *told* about a copy and reads a finished one.
 *
 * So a change is settled when its contents have been read, not when they have
 * been noticed. The wait is bounded, because an unreadable pasteboard is also
 * what a copy this helper does not carry looks like — a folder, or a format
 * belonging to one application — and that must not be re-read for ever.
 *
 * No AppKit here on purpose: this is the part worth testing, and NSPasteboard
 * is not reachable from the host tests.
