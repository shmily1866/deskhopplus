/*
 * What each output *does* — the shim's two switches, with the platform behind
 * a protocol (#152).
 *
 * Both services below it are covered in depth: `HelperSession` binds the
 * shared C core, `ClipboardService` joins the seal to the transfer, and both
 * have their own suites. The layer that turns each of their outputs into a
 * real effect had none, so every arm was correct by reading only — a service
 * could be proved to emit the right output while the shim dropped it, called
 * the wrong thing, or fell through. That is the shape of #93 and #94: a helper
 * that reports healthy while doing nothing.
 *
 * No IOKit and no AppKit here, which is why this file lives in DeskhopChannel
 * rather than beside HelperRuntime. The transport, the pasteboard and the
 * Keychain stay in the executable target behind `HelperEffects`, and this file
 * only decides which of them an output reaches.
 *
 * The Windows twin is output_dispatch.h/.cpp, and the two are deliberately the
 * same shape — a divergence between them is a clipboard that works on one
 * computer and not the other. One arm is not the same, and by decision: the
 * State arm there checks that the wording knows the state (#119) and drives a
 * tray. The same check happens here one layer up — `HelperSession.convert`
 * turns a state `HelperState` has no case for into a `.note` before it becomes
 * an output — so by the time a `.state` arrives it is already worded; and this
 * helper has no tray.
 *
 * Single-threaded by construction, like the rest of the helper.
 */

/*
 * Every effect an output can have, named once.
 *
 * HelperRuntime implements each of these in a line or two over the real object
 * — the IOKit transport, the pasteboard, the Keychain — and a test implements
 * them by writing down what it was asked to do.
