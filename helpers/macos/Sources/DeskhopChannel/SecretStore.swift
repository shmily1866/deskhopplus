/*
 * Where the helper keeps its identity and the board it is paired with.
 *
 * **Identity**: a Secure Enclave P-256 key, generated on first run and never
 * extractable. Same-user malware can *use* the key while it runs — keychain
 * ACLs that would prevent that bind to a stable code signature, and this
 * helper is unsigned and frequently rebuilt — but it cannot copy the key off
 * the machine, so the credential cannot outlive the infection and re-pairing
 * genuinely revokes. ADR-0008 records this trade.
 *
 * **Pinned board key**: the 64-byte P-256 public key the board sent in its
 * PAIR_GRANT. A board whose key changes is a board that was wiped past its
 * identity sector, re-flashed, or swapped.
 *
 * What is *not* here: any shared secret. The helper re-derives it inside the
 * Secure Enclave each session (~1 ms) and never stores it.
 *
 * On first run after an upgrade from v1, the old `secret` file is deleted.
