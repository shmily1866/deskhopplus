/*
 * This helper's end of the clipboard seal (#113, ADR-0008).
 *
 * The bulk payload is encrypted between the two *helpers*, so the boards relay
 * ciphertext and hold no key that opens it. Everything that decides what is
 * sealed, under which key and with which nonce lives in the shared core
 * (`dh_seal.h`), for the same reason the session machine does: a rule both
 * helpers must agree on cannot have two implementations to drift between.
 *
 * What is here is the two things only this platform can provide.
 *
 * **The cipher.** ADR-0008 chose AES-256-GCM because both helpers already have
 * it — CryptoKit here, CNG on Windows — so no hand-written AES ships and the
 * firmware links none at all. `cryptoKitAEAD` below is that seam, and nothing
 * else in this file knows what the cipher is.
 *
 * **The entropy.** The core draws nothing of its own: an ephemeral key, a
 * nonce and a seal id are bytes handed in, exactly as the hello's nonce and
 * correlation value already are.
 *
 * The identity key in `SecretStore` is *not* used here. A seal's keys are
 * ephemeral, per seal, and there is no long-term identity in the exchange —
 * what vouches for the peer is that board A relays only what its own
 * registered helper authenticated (docs/protocol.md, "What each board vouches
 * for"), which ADR-0008 records as the decision's one uncomfortable lean.
