 * is the wording, because a Windows tray tooltip and a macOS menu bar item are
 * not one string table living in C.
 *
 * The distinction that carries a security property: **only `notPaired` prompts
 * the pair chord**, because the chord provisions whatever is attached to the
 * channel during its window (#34). Two states here are precisely the ones a
 * chord press would make worse — `listenerDetected`, where something else is
 * writing to the channel, and `boardIdentityChanged`, where pressing it is the
 * act that accepts a swapped board. That rule is *not* re-decided here: both
 * predicates below call the core's, so a second helper cannot answer them
 * differently.
 *
 * `channelHeld` — *"Another program holds the channel"* — used to carry that
 * rule and is gone (#72, #114, ADR-0008). It asserted something macOS does
 * not promise: a second `kIOHIDOptionsTypeSeizeDevice` open succeeded on
 * 2026-08-13 (#95) and is refused on macOS 15.7.9 (#191, 2026-09-14), so the
 * open is not refused *reliably* for the reason the message named. What
 * replaces it is `listenerDetected`, which is measured rather than assumed —
 * the board counts frames it could not authenticate and says so.
