/*
 * The macOS helper's presence in the menu bar (#54's first slice, built here
 * because #56 needs it).
 *
 * Until now this helper had no user interface at all: it ran from a LaunchAgent
 * and wrote to a log nobody has open. That was survivable while everything it
 * carried was instant. It stops being survivable the moment a paste can take
 * four minutes and has to be *agreed to* first — the acceptance, the
 * progress and the abort all need somewhere to live, and #42 decided that
 * somewhere is a permanent menu-bar presence rather than a window that appears
 * and goes.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE QUESTION IS A PANEL AND NOT AN ALERT
 *
 * `NSAlert.runModal` blocks the run loop, and this helper's run loop is what
 * carries the session's heartbeat — so an unanswered dialog would time the
 * session out and drop the very transfer it is asking about. The panel below
 * is non-activating and non-modal: it takes no focus from what the user is
 * typing into, and the loop keeps turning underneath it.
 *
 * The menu carries the same two answers, so a panel dismissed or missed does
 * not strand the offer.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THIS NEEDS A WINDOW SERVER
 *
 * `NSStatusItem` does. The LaunchAgent runs in the user's GUI session
 * (`gui/$UID`, ProcessType Interactive), so it has one. Running the helper
 * over ssh with nobody logged in does not, and is not a supported arrangement
 * — the helper reads this machine's pasteboard, which needs the same session.
