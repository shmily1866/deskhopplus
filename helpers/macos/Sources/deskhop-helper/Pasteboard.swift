/*
 * This computer's pasteboard: what was copied here, and what arrives from the
 * other computer (#52, #55, #56).
 *
 * Text, images and files are carried. A file copy is read as a *list* and not
 * as bytes — the contents are not touched until the other computer's user
 * accepts the transfer, which is the whole of #56 and the reason `onLocalFiles`
 * hands over a closure rather than a payload.
 *
 * Two things here are not obvious and are both requirements rather than
 * choices.
 *
 * **Polling.** macOS has no pasteboard-change notification. `changeCount` is
 * the only signal there is, so a timer is not laziness; it is the API. A fifth
 * of a second is what mkroamer settled on and is below the threshold at which
 * a copy-then-switch feels like it did not happen.
 *
 * When a poll has actually *seen* a copy is subtler than it looks, because the
 * count moves before the bytes do — `CopyWatch` in the channel module owns
 * that, and says why.
 *
 * **Host-only writes.** Received content is written with
 * `NSPasteboardContentsCurrentHostOnly`, so it does not travel onward over
 * Universal Clipboard. A project whose premise is removing the radio between
 * these two computers would otherwise put the clipboard straight back on one
 * (spec #42, "Clipboard behaviour"). This is the whole of that guarantee, and
 * it is one flag — which is exactly why it is worth a paragraph: it is
 * invisible when it is missing.
