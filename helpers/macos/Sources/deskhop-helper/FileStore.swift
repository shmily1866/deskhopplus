/*
 * Where files that arrive from the other computer are written (#56).
 *
 * Copying a file puts a *reference* on the clipboard, not its contents, so
 * pasting one that came over the link means there has to be a real file at a
 * real path to point at. This is that path — and because these are files
 * nobody asked to keep, it is a temporary directory that is swept when the
 * helper starts, rather than a folder in the user's own space that would slowly
 * fill up with things they never chose to save (#42, story 11).
 *
 * Emptied on **start** rather than on a timer or at exit, deliberately. A
 * helper that crashes never runs an exit path, and a timer would delete a file
 * the user is still working on.
 *
 * **The newest set survives that sweep**, and the reason is the crash. A file
 * reference on the pasteboard is a path, and a path outlives the process that
 * put it there — so a helper that crashed and was restarted by launchd,
 * seconds after files arrived, would delete the very files the user is about
 * to paste and leave a reference pointing at nothing. Keeping one set costs a
 * bounded amount of disk and is not accumulation: every run leaves at most one
 * behind.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTHING PARTIAL IS EVER LEFT BEHIND
 *
 * A transfer that fails delivers nothing at all — the transfer machine
 * discards an incomplete payload rather than handing it over — so this is only
 * ever called with every byte in hand. What can still fail is the writing, and
 * a set half-written to disk would put working references to truncated files
 * on the pasteboard. So a failure removes the whole directory and reports
 * nothing, which is the same rule one layer up.
