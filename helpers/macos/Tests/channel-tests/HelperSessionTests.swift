 *
 * These describe the **helper**, and the decisions behind them belong to the
 * shared core (`dh_helper`, #80). What each one proves here is that the
 * binding carries the event down and the answer back with nothing lost —
 * every number, every frame, every state. The core's own arithmetic is
 * `tests/helper_test.c`'s subject: the beat trace, the backoff, and the
 * correlation guards moved there with the machine (#81).
 *
 * The fixture plays a board with a real P-256 key pair, so the frames it
 * feeds in are tagged the way the firmware tags them. A test that wants to
 * break authentication has to break it deliberately; nothing is waved through.
