 * The shim's dispatch (#152): that each output case reaches the effect it
 * names.
 *
 * This is the layer #93 and #94 are shaped like — a helper reporting healthy
 * while doing nothing. `HelperSession` and `ClipboardService` are both covered
 * in depth, and until this file existed the code that turned each of their
 * outputs into a real effect was correct by reading only.
 *
 * What is *not* checked here is IOKit or AppKit. The transport, the pasteboard
 * and the Keychain stay behind `HelperEffects`, which a `Recorder` implements
 * by writing down what it was asked to do. That is the whole reason the
 * dispatch was split out of HelperRuntime, and it is why this runs on a laptop
 * with no device attached.
 *
 * The Windows twin is helpers/windows/tests/output_dispatch_test.cpp.
 */

 * Every effect, written down in the order it was asked for.
 *
 * One list rather than a flag per effect, deliberately: the ordering is part
 * of what is being claimed — a refused frame must be counted *and* said out
