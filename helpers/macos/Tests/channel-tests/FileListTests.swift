 * The Swift side of the file list (#56).
 *
 * The format itself is `tests/file_list_test.c`'s — this is the binding, and
 * what it can get wrong is different: a pointer into a buffer that has already
 * gone, a length in the wrong units, a name decoded as the wrong bytes. So
 * these drive round trips and awkward names rather than restating the wire
 * layout a second time.
 *
 * `FileNaming` is here rather than beside the filesystem call because it is a
 * rule both helpers follow, and because the case it exists for — two files in
 * one delivery that want the same name — is the one nobody produces by
 * accident while testing by hand.
