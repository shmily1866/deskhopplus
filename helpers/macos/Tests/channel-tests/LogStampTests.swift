 * The log line's shape (#103).

 * The helper's log is the verification surface until the menu bar exists

 * lost a duration to that, and one of them manufactured a wrong number rather
 * than merely missing one: file mtime against a later baseline suggested
 * config mode had run 2.5 minutes and contradicted a 300 s timeout that was
 * working correctly.
 *
 * So the format is pinned by test rather than left to whoever edits the
 * emitter next. Each check below is a way the log has been, or could be, read
 * back wrong.
